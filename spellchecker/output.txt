which separated the two offices i was generally left open so that he could answer our questions save when a client closed it to discuss private matters with him and when this door was left open we could hear in our office everything that was said in m [mennesson's] {} room as he could hear in his office all that went on in ours this m [lebègue] {} some months before had married one of m [deviolaine's] {} daughters by his first marriage her name was Éléonore the eldest daughter [léontine] {} had been married to a tax collector named [cornu] {corns, corny, corn} some time before her sister's wedding the singularity of the name had not prevented the marriage from coming off the sharp tongued young girl feared to be jeered at in her turn and the wittier she became the more she dreaded even the appearance of being ridiculous but [cornu] {corns, corny, corn} was such a good [natured] {matured, natures, nature} honest [hearted] {hearten, heated} fellow everybody was so used to the name which had been borne by several families in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} he was so used to it himself he responded so [naïvely] {naively} and triumphantly to the remarks of his [fiancée] {fiancee, fiance} that the matter was settled when she was married to him she made up her mind to raise the unfortunate name which fate had given her above even the suspicion of any banter naturally connected with it she was the most chaste of wives the tenderest of mothers i have ever known and her husband a happy man himself made her happy too but it was not so with her sister madame [lebègue] {} who was three or four years younger prettier and far more of a flirt than she was her flirtations were innocent enough i have no doubt but they were as a rule looked upon maliciously by the gossips of the little town a matter to which madame [lebègue] {} in her innocence paid little heed concerning which in her indifference to such calumnies she simply teased her husband he was a stout rotund fellow pockmarked rather ugly with a somewhat common looking face but a good fellow at heart although i have been told since that he ruined himself not from having lent at too low interest but from an entirely opposite reason i am wholly ignorant as to the truth of this accusation i take it to be a calumny similar to the more pleasing and certainly more human accusation [levelled] {leveled, leveled} against the wife it was this man who had just come in who sat down by m [mennesson] {} and who was at that moment holding a whispered conversation with him interspersed with guffaws of laughter thanks to the extremely delicate hearing with which i was gifted by nature and which i had cultivated during hunting i thought i could distinguish my own name but i supposed i had not heard correctly not flattering myself that two such grave personages could be doing me the [honour] {honor} of talking about me unluckily for my pride and i have indicated to what a pitch this feeling was developed in me a height that would have been absurd if it had not been painful unluckily for my pride then i was not kept long in doubt that the discussion was about me i have said that m [mennesson] {} was very fond of a joke and very witty wherever he could find a joke he would fasten upon it no matter whether it happened to concern a woman's virtue or a man's reputation when the frenzy of joking seized him he gave himself up to it unreservedly heart and soul finding nothing probably on this day better to chew he set upon me the pasture was poor but it was far better to crack my sorry bones than to chew at nothing or gulp only the air after several of those whispered remarks then and bursts of stifled laughter which had disturbed my equanimity m [mennesson] {} raised his voice my dear friend he said it is a chapter out of the [diable] {liable, viable, doable, dibble, disable} [boiteux] {} re discovered and still unpublished which i mean to have printed the next time i go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to complete [lesage's] {} work ah tell it me [lebègue] {} replied i will tell it to my wife who will pass it on to her sisters who will tell it to everybody then our publication will be disposed of in advance m [mennesson] {} began there was once upon a time at [salamanca] {} a scholar who was descended from a race of [arabs] {crabs, drabs, grabs} and who was called [samud] {} [1] he was still so young that if anyone had pulled his nose milk would most certainly have come out this did not prevent him from being absurd enough to fancy himself a man perhaps also for to be fair we must say all there is to say this ridiculous fancy would not have entered his head had not that happened which we are about to relate it may be imagined that i was listening attentively i had [recognised] {recognized} from the very first words that i was undoubtedly the person in question and i wondered uneasily where the story was going to lead after this beginning a beginning which so far as i was concerned i found more impertinent than graphic m [mennesson] {} went on and i listened with my ears open my pen idle in my hand on the day of the feast of [whitsuntide] {} in the year i cannot say the exact date of the year but any way it was on the day of the feast of [whitsuntide] {} which is also the town's feast time two beautiful [senoras] {} arrived from [madrid] {} and put up at the house of a worthy canon who was the uncle of one of these ladies it chanced that this canon was the same with whom [samud] {} had [learnt] {learns, learn} the bit of [latin] {satin, lain} he knew and as the two lovely [madrid] {} ladies wanted a cavalier who would not put their virtue to the blush the canon cast his eyes on his pupil and requested him to place both his arms at the disposal of the new arrivals to show them the park of [salamanca] {} which is very wide very beautiful and belongs to the duke of [rodelnas] {} [2] i will not dwell on the adventures of the first day beyond just briefly touching upon two events the first was the meeting between our scholar and an elegant [senor] {tenor, senior, sensor} from [madrid] {} who was noticed at once by the [sefiora] {} [lorenza] {} with whom our scholar was walking arm in arm dressed as people of the provinces often are about a decade behind the fashions of the capital this young gallant was called [audim] {audio, audit} the second was a most serious accident which happened to the scholar's breeches just when in order to give the fair [lorenza] {} a proof of his agility he had leaped across a ditch fourteen feet wide it can be imagined what i suffered as i listened to this secondhand recital of my lovelorn tribulations which according to his method of procedure would not stop short at the two misadventures of the first day m [mennesson] {} continued the beautiful [lorenza] {} was specially impressed by the young gallant's get up in complete contrast to the scholar who was muffled up in a [gothic] {} costume borrowed from the wardrobe of his ancestors [señor] {} [audim] {audio, audit} was dressed in the latest fashion in tight fitting breeches ending in charming little heart shaped shoes and a dark [coloured] {colored} doublet turned out by one of the best tailors in [madrid] {} the scholar had not been unconscious of the particular notice his companion had paid to the handsome [audim's] {audio's, audit's} attire and as it began to dawn on him what influence a coat of a certain cut or trousers of a special shade of [colour] {color} might have upon a woman he decided during the night following the [fête] {fate, fete} to please [lorenza] {} no matter at what price and to have a suit made exactly like the one worn by the young man who seemed destined by fate to become his rival the most vital part of the costume and moreover the most expensive was in the matter of the boots so he turned his attention to them first of all on the opposite side of the square where [samud's] {} mother lived a square called the place [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [fontaine] {} was the best boot maker in the town he had always shod the scholar but hitherto he had only made shoes for him the lad's tender years not having put the idea into anyone's head not even into his own that he could wear any other covering for his feet than shoes or sandals without risking a too close resemblance to [perrault's] {} venerable puss in boots great therefore was m [landereau's[3]] {} surprise when his customer came and boldly asked the price of a pair of boots he stared at [samud] {} 'a pair of boots ' he asked 'for whom ' 'why for myself ' the scholar proudly replied 'has your mother given you leave to order boots ' 'yes ' the [bootmaker] {bookmaker} shook his head dubiously he knew [samud's] {} mother was not well off and that it would be foolish of her to allow such extravagance in her son 'boots are dear ' he said 'that does not matter how much are they ' 'they would cost you exactly four dollars ' 'good take my measure ' 'i have told you i can do nothing without leave from your mother ' 'i will see you have it ' returning home the scholar ventured to ask for a pair of boots the request struck [samud's] {} mother as so extraordinary that she made him repeat his inquiry twice it was all the more strange as it was the first time the scholar had troubled about his dress when he was ten they had the greatest difficulty in the world to get him to give up a long pinafore of figured cotton which he considered far more comfortable than all the breeches and all the doublets on earth then from the age of ten to the age of fifteen he had worn with indifference any garments his mother had thought good to put him in always preferring dirty and old ones to clean and new because in them he was allowed to go out in all weathers and to roll about in all kinds of places so the demand for a pair of boots seemed to his poor mother altogether most unprecedented and she was alarmed for her son's reason 'a pair of boots ' she repeated 'what will you wear them with ' 'a pair of tight fitting breeches mother ' 'a pair of tight fitting breeches but you must know your legs are as spindle shaped as a cock's ' 'excuse me mother ' the schoolboy replied with some show of logic 'if i have good enough calves to wear short breeches they are good enough to wear tight fitting breeches ' the mother admired her son's wit and half conquered by the repartee she said 'we might perhaps manage to find the tight fitting trousers in the clothes press but the boots where will you find the boots ' 'why at [landereau's] {} ' 'but boots would be expensive my child ' said the poor lady sighing 'and you know we are not rich ' 'bah mamma [landereau] {} will allow you credit ' 'it is all very fine taking credit my boy you know one has to pay some day and that the longer one puts off paying the more it costs ' 'oh mother please do let me ' 'how much will the boots cost ' 'four dollars mother ' 'that is six [months'] {months} school money at the rate good canon [gregorio] {} charges me ' 'you can pay for it in four [months'] {months} time mother ' the schoolboy pleaded 'still tell me what advantage you think this pair of boots and the tight fitting trousers will bring you ' 'i shall be able to please [doña] {} [lorenza] {} the canon's niece ' 'how is that ' 'she raves over boots and tight fitting trousers it seems they are the very latest thing in [madrid] {} ' 'but what does it matter to you what the niece of don [gregorio] {} raves or does not rave over i want to know ' 'it matters a great deal to me mother ' 'why ' the schoolboy looked supremely foolish 'because i am paying her attentions ' he said this dialogue was word for word what had passed between my mother and myself after i returned from [landereau's] {} shop so i grew hot with anger at the words because i am paying her attentions continued the narrator [samud's] {} mother was overcome with intense astonishment her son whom she still pictured as running about the streets in his long print pinafore or renewing his baptismal vows taper in hand her son paying attentions to the beautiful [doña] {} [lorenza] {} why it was one of those absurd things she had never even imagined and her son seeing she was unconvinced drew his hand out of his breast pocket and showed her a bracelet of hair with a mosaic clasp but he took care to keep it to himself that he had taken this bracelet from [doña] {} [lorenza] {} she had not given it him and she was very much distressed at not knowing what had become of it although this account was not very creditable to my honesty it was dreadfully accurate i had had that bracelet in my possession for three days during those three days i had if not exactly shown it at least let it be seen by several people and among others by my mother and my cousins the [deviolaines] {} before whom i posed as a gallant youth but at length i had been moved by [laure's] {laurels, lure's, laurel's} distress as she had thought it lost i gave it back to her humbly confessing my fault she forgave me in consideration no doubt of her delight in recovering her trinket but she would not have let me off so easily had she known my indiscretions so the perspiration which had beaded my brow at the beginning of the story ran down over my face in big drops yet wishing to learn how far m [mennesson] {} had been coached in the matter of my sentimental escapades i had the courage to stay where i was or rather i had not the strength to fly m [mennesson] {} went on at this juncture [samud's] {} mother raised her hands and eyes to heaven and as the poor woman never could refuse her son she said to him with a sigh 'very well be it so if a pair of boots will make you happy go and order the boots ' the schoolboy [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} at one bound from his house to the [bootmaker's] {bookmaker's} he arranged the price at three and a half dollars to be paid for in four [months'] {months} time next they paid a visit to the clothes press they extracted a pair of bright blue trousers striped with gold they sold the gold lace to a goldsmith for a dollar and a half which dollar and a half were given to the scholar for pocket money his mother guessing that his budding love affairs would naturally bring extra expenses in their train they decided that the suit he had worn at his first communion should be altered to a more up to date cut on fashionable lines while all these preparations for courtship were going on the schoolboy continued in the phrase he had used to his mother to pay attentions to the beautiful [doña] {} [lorenza] {} but although he was brave in words and very clever in theory behind her back he was extremely timid in practice and very awkward when actually before her face while apparently filled with impatience to be near her he dreaded nothing so much as being left alone with her at such times he would lose his wits completely become dumb instead of talkative and be still when he should have been active the most [favourable] {favorable} opportunities were given him and he let them escape in vain did the impatient lady from [madrid] {} give him to understand that he was wasting time and that time wasted is never regained he agreed with her from the very depths of his soul he was furious with himself every night when he returned home and in going over the opportunities of the day he vowed not to let these opportunities slip by on the morrow if they occurred again then he would read a chapter of [faublas] {} to warm his blood he would sleep on it and dream dreams in which he would be astonishingly bold when day broke he would vow to himself to carry out his dreams of the previous night then while he was waiting for the boots and the tight fitting suit which were being fashioned with a truly provincial slowness he returned to his short breeches his [bombazin] {} vest his bottle blue coat and resumed his fruitless walk in the forest he looked with a melancholy eye on the mossy carpet under their feet not even venturing to suggest to his companion that they should sit down upon it he gazed sadly on the beautiful green heights above them under which she delighted to hide herself with him he would get as far as trembling and sighing even to pressing her hand but these were the extreme limits of his boldness once only did he kiss the hand of [doña] {} [lorenza] {} on the night before he was to introduce himself to her in his suit of conquest but it cost him such a tremendous effort to perform this bold act that he felt quite ill after its accomplishment it was on this day that the lovely [doña] {} [lorenza] {} arrived at the conclusion that she must give up all hope of seeing the boy develop into a man and without saying a word to her clumsy admirer she took a decisive step they parted as usual after having spent the evening playing at those innocent games which madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [longueville] {} detested so greatly the next day as we have said was to be the vital one the tailor and the [bootmaker] {bookmaker} kept their word the young people usually met between noon and one o'clock and then went for a walk [senora] {} [vittoria] {} with a young bachelor from whom i have gathered most of my information and the schoolboy with [senora] {} [lorenza] {} unluckily the tight fitting trousers were so tight that they had to have a piece put in at the calf of the leg this addition took time and [samud] {} was not quite ready before one o'clock he knew he was late he flew hurriedly along to canon [gregorio's] {} house where the daily rendezvous took place his new toilette produced an excellent effect as he passed through the streets people ran to their doors they [leant] {meant, least, leans, lent, lean} out of their windows and he bowed to them saying to himself 'yes it is all right it is i what is there wonderful in this pray did you think no one else could have boots tight fitting trousers and a fashionably collared coat like m [audim] {audio, audit} you are much deceived if you thought anything of the kind ' and he went on his way holding his head higher and higher persuaded he was nearing a sensational triumph but as we have said the unlucky alteration at the calves had made him nearly an hour late and when the scholar reached the canon's house both the [senoras] {} had gone out this was but a slight misfortune the schoolboy had been brought up in the forest of [salamanca] {} as [osmin] {} in the seraglio of [bajazet] {} and he knew its every turn and twist he was therefore just going to rush out in pursuit of the lady of his thoughts when the canon's sister handed him a letter which [doña] {} [lorenza] {} had left for him when she went out [samud] {} never doubted that this letter would enjoin upon him to hurry on with all diligence and it was the first he had received he felt the [honour] {honor} most keenly he kissed the letter tenderly broke the seal and with panting breath and bounding heart he read the following 'my dear boy i have been blaming myself during the past fortnight for imposing upon your good nature by letting you [fulfil] {fulfill, fulfill} the obligation you had most [injudiciously] {} promised my uncle in undertaking to be my cavalier in spite of your efforts to hide the boredom that an occupation beyond your years caused you i have seen that i have much interfered with your usual habits and i blame myself for it go back to your young playmates who are waiting for you to play at [prisoners'] {prisoners} base and quoits let your mind be quite at ease on my account for i have accepted m [audim's] {audio's, audit's} services for the short time longer i remain with my uncle please accept my best thanks my dear child for your kindness and believe me yours very gratefully [lorenza] {} ' if a thunderbolt had fallen at our schoolboy's feet he could not have been more crushed than he was on receiving this letter on the first reading he [realised] {realized} nothing beyond the shock he re read it two or three times and felt the smart then it dawned on him that since he had taken no pains to prove to the lovely [lorenza] {} that he was not a child it now remained to him to prove that he was a man by provoking [audim] {audio, audit} to fight a dud with him and forthwith upon my word our outraged schoolboy sent this letter to his rival 'sir i need not tell you upon what provocation i wish to meet you in any of the forest avenues accompanied by two seconds you know as well as i do as you may pretend that you have not insulted me and that it is i who have provoked you i leave the choice of weapons to you i have the [honour] {honor} to remain ' etc ' p s as you will probably not return home till late to night i will not demand my answer this evening but i wish to receive it as early as possible to morrow morning ' next morning on waking he received a birch rod with don [audim's] {audio's, audit's} card that was the weapon selected by his rival the reader can judge the effect the conclusion of this story had upon me alas it was an exact account of all that had happened to me thus had terminated my first love affair and so had ended my first duel i uttered a shriek of rage and dashing out of the office i ran home to my mother who cried out aloud when she saw the state i was in ten minutes later i was lying in a well warmed bed and doctor [lécosse] {} had been sent for he pronounced that i was in for brain fever but as it was taken in time it would not have any serious consequences i purposely prolonged my convalescence be it known so as not to go out until the two [parisians] {} had left [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i have never seen either of them since [1] hardly need point out that [samud] {} is the anagram of [dumas] {pumas, dumps} [2] [rodelnas] {} is the anagram of [d'orléans] {} as [samud] {} is the anagram of [dumas] {pumas, dumps} and as [audim] {audio, audit} to be used shortly is that of [miaud] {} [3] the narrator did not trouble to give an anagram for the name this time chapter [ii] {hi, mi, pi, ti, id} the good my flouting at the hands of the two [parisians] {} had done me the young girls of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} my three friends first love affairs still like [françois] {} i after the battle of [pavia] {} i had not lost everything by my defeat first there remained to me my boots and my tight fitting trousers those two dearly coveted articles which became the envy and admiration of those young companions upon whom the lovely [laure] {lure, laurel} had so cruelly thrown me besides in the fortnight spent in the company of those two smart girls i had [learnt] {learns, learn} the first lesson that only the society of women can give this lesson had taught me to [realise] {realize, realism, realist} the need for that care of my personal appearance which had hitherto never presented itself to my mind as a thing to be daily attended to beneath the ridiculous if vanity in changing my mode of dress underneath the unlucky attempt that i a poor country lad had made to attain to the elegant style of a [parisian] {} there appeared the first [dawnings] {awnings, dawning} of true elegance that is to say of neatness i had rather good hands my nails were well shaped my teeth were large but white and my feet were singularly small considering my size i had been ignorant of all these possessions until they had been pointed out to me by the two [parisian] {} girls who gave me advice as to how i could enhance the value of my natural gifts and i continued to follow their advice for my own personal satisfaction after at first following it to please them to such purpose that by the time they left i had really stepped across the boundary which separated childhood from youth the crossing had certainly been a rough one and i had accomplished it with tears in my eyes [coquetry] {} holding one of my hands and chagrin the other then as jaded [travellers] {travelers, travelers} when they enter a fresh country suck bitter fruits which however much they set the teeth on edge leave behind them an irresistible desire to suck other fruits when my lips had touched the apple of eve that men call love i yearned to make another attempt even though it should be more painful than the first and so far as its young girls were concerned few towns could boast themselves as well [favoured] {favored} as [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} never was there such a large park as ours not even at [versailles] {} no lawns were greener not even those at [brighton] {brighten} nor were any studded with more exquisite flowers than the park of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} with its lawns and flower beds three very distinct classes disputed among themselves for the crown of beauty the aristocracy the middle classes and a third class for which i cannot find a name a pleasant intermediary between the middle class and the people which belongs to neither and to which class the dressmakers seamstresses and women shopkeepers of a town belong the first class was represented by the [collard] {collars, collar, collared} family to whom i have already alluded in connection with my childhood of the three madcap young girls who roamed the forest of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} as free as the butterflies and swallows two had become wives one [caroline] {caroling} had married the baron [capelle] {} the other [hermine] {heroine, ermine} had married the baron [de] {be, he, me, re, we} martens [louise] {louse} the third who was but fifteen was the most captivating little maiden imaginable their mother whose birth and history as the daughter of madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [genlis] {} and the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} i have related and her three children were the aristocratic [centre] {} round which the young men and maidens of the [neighbouring] {neighboring} castles revolved and among the former of these were some of the best blood in the country the [montbretons] {} the [courvals] {} and the [mornays] {morays} none of these families lived in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} itself they lived in the castles around only on great occasions did the hives swarm and then we saw these golden winged bees flying about the streets of the town and down the avenues of the park the second class was represented by the [deviolaine] {} family two out of the five daughters of m [deviolaine] {} were married as i have said namely [léontine] {} and Éléonore three remained [cécile] {} [augustine] {} and [louise] {louse} [cécile] {} was twenty years of age [augustine] {} sixteen [louise] {louse} was still a mere child [cécile] {} had preserved her whimsical and capricious spirits the same mocking and animated features her actions were more masculine than feminine her complexion was tanned by the sun as she never took the trouble to protect herself from its rays [augustine] {} on the contrary had a skin as white as milk large tranquil blue eyes dark chestnut hair forming an admirable framework round her face sloping shoulders charmingly [moulded] {mounded, molded} and a figure that was not too slender unlike her sister [cécile] {} she was gracefully feminine in all her ways [raphael] {} would have been puzzled to choose between her and [louise] {louse} [collard] {collars, collar, collared} for a model for his [madonna] {} and like the [greek] {creek, greed, green, greet, reek} sculptor he would have selected beautiful points from them both to reach that perfect standard to which art everywhere attains when it surpasses nature the other young girls of the middle class grouped themselves round the [deviolaine] {} family the two [troisvallet] {} girls [henriette] {} and [clementine] {} [clementine] {} dark with beautiful black hair strangely attractive eyes a roman complexion of the type of [velletri] {} or [subiaco] {} and a head like one of [augustine] {} [carrachi's] {} [henriette] {} was tall fair rosy slender gracious and as pliant in her gentle youthfulness as a rose as a blade of corn as a willow tree she had that type of face which is half sad half merry the transition between angel and woman showing all the common needs of earth yet full of heavenly aspirations too then the two charming girls [sophie] {} and [pélagie] {} [perrot] {parrot} [louise] {louse} [moreau] {} a sweet young girl who has since become the admirable mother of a family Éléonore [picot] {pilot, pivot} of whom i have spoken an excellent woman saddened by the death of her brother [stanislas] {} and the shameful charge that had weighed for a short time upon her brother [auguste] {august, auguster} then there were others too whose names i have forgotten but whose fresh faces still appear in my mind's eye like the phantoms of a dream or like the apparitions which glide out of [german] {merman, germane} streams or are reflected in the [lochs] {locks, locus} of [scotland] {} as they pursue their nocturnal rounds lastly after the middle classes came as i have said the group of young girls which i cannot class in the social hierarchy but which held the same place in that small world of ours shut in by the green girdle of its beautiful forest that lilies of the valley [easter] {caster, faster, master, raster, taster} daisies cornflowers hyacinths and [pompon] {pompom} roses hold among flowers oh but it was a pretty sight to see them on [sunday] {sundry, sundae} in their summer dresses with pink and blue sashes their tiny bonnets trimmed by their own hands and put on in a hundred varieties of coquettish ways for in those days not one of them dare wear a hat it was a delight to see them free of all constraint ignorant of any etiquette playing racing lacing and interlacing their charming round bare arms in long chains what exquisite creatures they were what delightful young things it is of little interest to my readers i am well aware to know their names but i knew them i loved them i spent my earliest years among them those gentle opening days in the morning of life i wish to tell their names i wish to paint their portraits i wish to describe their different charms and then i hope they will pardon my indiscretions for my very [indiscretions'] {indiscretions} sake i must mention first and foremost two charmingly romantic and coquettish damsels [joséphine] {} and [manette] {} [thierry] {} [joséphine] {} dark rosy with an ample figure and regular features a perfect creature whose beautiful teeth completed a ravishing whole [manette] {} a dessert apple a girl who was always singing to make herself heard always laughing to show off her teeth ever running to let her feet her ankles even the calves of her legs be seen [virgil's] {virgin's, vigil's} [galatea] {} whose very name she was ignorant of flying to be pursued hiding so as to be seen before she hid what has become of them i have seen them since looking very miserable one was at [versailles] {} the other in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} the fallen faded fruits of that rosary on which i spelled out the first phrases of love they were the daughters of an old tailor and lived close to the church which was only separated from them by the town hall [louise] {louse} [brézette] {} lived nearly opposite them i have already mentioned her she was the niece of my dancing master a sturdy flower of fifteen whom i had in my mind while i wrote my fictitious history of that [tulipe] {tulips, tulip} [noire] {moire, noise} the masterpiece of horticulture vainly sought after vainly pursued vainly expected by [dutch] {butch, hutch, ditch} amateur gardeners the hair of beautiful madame [ronconi] {} which inspired one of [théophile] {} [gautier's] {} most wonderful articles and which made coal look [grey] {prey, gray, grew} and the wings of a crow pale when placed side by side with it was not more black more blue more shiny than [louise] {louse} [brézette's] {} hair when it reflected the sun's rays from its dark and [sombre] {} depths as from the heart of polished metal oh what a lovely blooming brunette she was with her flesh as firm and bright as a nectarine's her pearly teeth lighting up her face from under the faint ebony down on her coral lips one could feel life and love bubbling up beneath needing only the first passion to make everything burst forth into flame this luxuriant young girl was religious and as such an [organisation] {organization} as hers must love something she loved god if you took a few steps towards the square a little farther up the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [soissons] {} bearing to the left there was a door and a window comprising the whole frontage of a tiny house in the window hung hats collars bonnets lace gloves mittens ribbons the whole arsenal in short of womanly vanity behind the door floated certain curtains intended to prevent inquisitive glances from looking into the shop but which whether by some strange mischance or from the obstinacy of the rod upon which they slid or from the caprices of the wind always left on one side or the other some impertinent aperture through which the passer by could see into the shop and at the same time allowed those inside the shop to see out into the street above this door and this window the following inscription was painted in large letters mesdemoiselles [rigolot] {} milliners truly those who stopped in front of the opening which i have indicated and who managed to cast a glance inside the shop did not lose their time nor regret their pains what we mean by this has no sort of connection with the two proprietors of the establishment who were both old maids having long since passed their fortieth year and i presume having lost all pretension to inspire any other sentiment than respect no what we have in view concerns two of the most adorable faces you can imagine placed side by side as though to set one another off one was a blonde and the other a brunette the brunette was [albine] {alpine, albino} [hardi] {hardy, hard} the blonde was [adèle] {addle} [dalvin] {} the brown head do you know the lovely [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [duplessis] {} that charming courtesan full of queenly grace upon whom my son wrote his romance la dame [aux] {tux, auk, ax} [camélias] {} well she was [albine] {alpine, albino} if you do not know her i will describe [albine] {alpine, albino} to you she was a young girl of seventeen with a dead brown complexion large brown velvety eyes and eyebrows so black that they seemed as though they had been drawn with a pencil the curve was so firm and so regular she was a duchess she was a queen better still than either if you will she was after the fashion of a nymph of [diana's] {} train slight slender straight and finely built a huntress whom it would have been a splendid sight to see with a plumed helmet on her head an amazon flying before the wind leading a troop of clamorous [pikemen] {} guiding a baying hound upon the stage her appearance would have been magnificent almost supernatural in ordinary life people were tempted to think her too beautiful and for some time nobody dared to make love to her it seemed so likely that their love would be wasted and that she would not make any response to it the other [adèle] {addle} was fair and pink complexioned i have never seen prettier golden hair sweeter eyes a more winning smile she was more inclined to be gay than melancholy short rather than tall plump rather than thin she was something like one of [murillo's] {} cherubs who kiss the feet of his virgins half veiled in clouds she was neither a [watteau] {} shepherdess nor one of [greuze's] {} peasant girls but something between the two one felt it would be a sweet and easy thing to love her although it might not be so easy to be loved by her her father and her mother were worthy old farmer folk thoroughly honest but vulgar and it was all the more surprising that so fresh and sweet scented a flower should have sprung from such a stock but this is always the case when folks are young it is youth that lends distinction as it is spring which lends freshness to the rose round these young people whom i have just described smiled and pouted a bevy of young girls the smallest being mere infants whom i have since seen succeed the youthful generation in which i lived i have sought in vain to find in these later children the virtues i found in those who preceded them until the arrival of the two strangers in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i had not even noticed the [springtide] {springtime} crown of stars and flowers to which all ranks of society contribute when the two strangers had left the bandage that had sealed my eyes fell off and i could say not merely i see but i live i found myself placed by my years exactly between the children who still played at [prisoners'] {prisoners} base and at quoits as the [abba's] {abbe's} niece had aptly put it and youths beginning to turn into men instead of returning to the former as my beautiful [parisian] {} had advised me i attached myself to the latter and drew myself up to my full height to prove my sixteen years and when anyone asked my age i told them i was seventeen the three youths with whom i was most intimate were first [fourcade] {} director of the school of self improvement sent from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} he was my [vis] {dis, his, pis, sis, via} à [vis] {dis, his, pis, sis, via} in my [début] {debut} as a dancing man he was a thoroughly well bred well educated young fellow son of a man very [honourably] {honorably} known in foreign affairs his father had lived in the east for many years and had been consul at [salonica] {} his affections were fixed upon [joséphine] {} [thierry] {} and he spent with her all the time he could spare from his teaching my second companion was [saunier] {saucier, saunter} he had been a fellow pupil with me under the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} [grégoire] {} he was second clerk of m [perrot] {parrot} the lawyer his father and grandfather were blacksmiths and in the idle period of my early youth i spent a large portion of my time in their forge notching their files and making fireworks out of iron filings [saunier] {saucier, saunter} divided his leisure time between two passions one which i verily believe came before the other was for the [clarionette] {} the other was for [manette] {} [thierry] {} the third of my intimate friends was called [chollet] {} he served as a link in the matter of age between [fourcade] {} and [saunier] {saucier, saunter} he lived with one of my cousins called [roussy] {} the father of the child of whom i had been godfather when nine months old along with [augustine] {} [deviolaine] {} he was studying the cultivation of forest land i know nothing about his relations they were probably wealthy for whenever i called on him there were five franc pieces scattered about on the mantelpiece and two or three gold pieces always shone out ostentatiously from the midst of them dazzling my eyes and impressing me profoundly with his riches but my admiration was entirely devoid of envy i have never envied either a man's money or his possessions i know not whether this arose from pride or from simpleness of mind i might have taken for my motto video [nec] {sec, nee, neg, net, new} [invideo] {} [chollet] {} had had no education at all but he was not wanting in a certain natural quick [wittedness] {} and he was a fine looking young fellow his magnificent eyes and splendid teeth redeeming an otherwise common looking face pitted with smallpox he did his best to make [louise] {louse} [brézette] {} change her love for the creator into love for the creature these were my three most intimate friends the upshot was that when it became necessary for me in my turn to make a choice although i had been brought up half with m [deviolaine's] {} family and half with m [collard's] {collar's} it was neither in aristocratic society nor in middle class circles which would have made fun of me that i sought my initiation in the delightful mystery of life we call falling in love but in that society to which my three friends almost exclusively addressed themselves and i had no difficulty in understanding their preference i do not hesitate to state fully and freely that they were very wise in their choice there was but one step to take to follow in their path i needed only someone upon whom to fasten my affections the wish to love was not wanting every one of the young girls i have mentioned had some love affair on hand of a more or less serious character they all enjoyed most delightful liberty the result no doubt of the confidence their parents placed in their good sense but for some reason or other we had quite an [english] {} custom in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} a free and easy association between young people of both sexes which i have never seen in any other french town a liberty all the more surprising since all the parents of these maidens were perfectly respectable people and had a profound conviction in the depths of their hearts that all the [barques] {} launched upon the flood of the tender passion were decked with white sails and crowned with orange blossoms and what was more singular still it was true in the case of the majority of the ten or twelve couples of lovers which formed our circle i waited patiently for one of these knots to be untied or severed while i waited i went to every party and took part in all the walks and all the dances it was an excellent apprenticeship which [familiarised] {familiarized} me beforehand with that monster whom psyche touched without seeing and whom i on the contrary had seen but not touched chance [favoured] {favored} me after six weeks or two months of playing second fiddle one of these engagements was hardly made before it was broken a farmer's son named [richou] {} wished to marry his [neighbour] {neighbor} [adèle] {addle} [dalvin] {} the parents of the young man who were better off than those of the young girl opposed these budding loves and the fair one was released i had [learnt] {learns, learn} much during those six weeks by watching others besides this time i was not entangled with a sarcastic and exacting [parisian] {} girl who knew the world so much better than i did no my love affair was with a young girl more shy than myself who mistook my pretended courage for genuine and who like the frog in the fable that jumped in the pond when a frightened hare passed by it was good enough to fear me and to prove to me that it was possible to come across someone even more timid than myself it can be seen how such a change in the position of things gave me assurance the [rôles] {riles, roles, rules} were now completely reversed this time i was the attacking party and someone else was on the defensive and this someone was making such an obstinate resistance that i soon [realised] {realized} my attack was useless and that i should only succeed in breaking down the serious resistance offered me after maybe a long and patient wooing the citadel was not to be stormed then began for me those first days the reflection of which has lasted throughout the whole of my life that delicious struggle of love which asks unceasingly and is not discouraged by an eternity of refusal the obtaining of [favour] {favor} after [favour] {favor} each of which when gained fills the soul with ecstasy the early fleeting dawn of life which hovers above the earth shaking down handfuls of flowers upon the heads of mortals and then under the influence of the rising sun adds consciousness to its joy and is soon enveloped in the ardent heat of passion indeed it was a happy time for me in the morning when i awoke my mother's smile greeted me and her lingering kisses hung on my lips from nine to four o'clock came my work work it is true which would have been tiresome if i had been obliged to understand what i wrote but which was easy and welcome for while my hands and eyes were copying my mind was free to commune with my own happy thoughts then from four till eight o'clock i was with my mother and after eight joy love life hope happiness at eight in summer evenings at six in winter our young friends also free when i was came to join us at some convenient meeting place held out their faces or their cheeks to be kissed pressed our hands without taking pains out of mistaken [coquetry] {} or hypocritical make belief to conceal their delight at meeting us once more then if it were summertime and fine weather the park invited us with its mossy sward its dusky avenues the breeze trembling among the leaves and on moonlight nights there were wide spaces of alternate light and darkness at these times a solitary passer by could have seen five or six couples walking at duly specified distances to ensure isolation without loneliness heads inclined towards one another hands clasped in hands talking in low tones modulating their words to sweet intonations or preserving a dangerous silence for during such silences the eyes often spoke what the lips did not dare to utter if it were winter or bad weather we all met at [louise] {louse} [brézette's] {} her mother and her aunt nearly always withdrew to the back room giving up to us the two front ones which we seized upon for ourselves then lit by a single lamp in the third room near which [louise's] {louse's} mother would sew while her aunt read the imitation of [christ] {} or the perfect [christian] {} we chatted squeezed against one another generally two on one chair repeating the same story we had said the night before but finding what we had to say ever new at ten o'clock our [soirées] {soirees} broke up each boy took his particular girl home when they reached the house door she granted her cavalier another half hour sometimes an hour as sweet to her as to him as they sat together on the bench outside the door or stood in the garden path which led to the maternal [parlour] {parlor} from the interior of which from time to time a grumbling voice might be heard calling a voice that was answered ten times before being obeyed i am coming mamma on [sundays] {sundaes} we met at three o'clock after vespers and we walked danced waltzed not going home until midnight then there were [fêtes] {fates, fetes} in the [neighbouring] {neighboring} villages less grand less aristocratic less fashionable certainly than those of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to which we went in happy bands and from which we returned in silent separate pairs it was at one of

[corey] {covey, corny, cored, cores, core} a league's distance from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} a village buried in the [centre] {} of great woods like a nest among high branches i had left my companions for an instant in the course of the dance and i had gone to some distance to pay a visit to an old friend of my father a farmer whose farm was nearly a quarter of a league from the village i took a pretty path at the foot of a hill to get there hedged on both sides by hawthorn in full blossom and studded with daisies their golden [centres] {} fringed by pink tipped petals suddenly at a bend in the path i saw three people coming towards me in a ray of sunlight which bathed them in light two were well known to me but the third was a complete stranger the two i knew were [caroline] {caroling} [collard] {collars, collar, collared} who as previously related had become baroness [capelle] {} the other was her daughter [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [capelle] {} then only three years old who to her misfortune was to become madame [lafarge] {} the third person the stranger looked at first sight like a [german] {merman, germane} student he was a youth of between sixteen and seventeen and was dressed in a [grey] {prey, gray, grew} jacket an oilskin cap a waistcoat of chamois leather and bright blue trousers almost as tight fitting as mine but with this difference that while my [topboots] {} covered up my breeches his on the contrary were covered up by his trousers this young man was tall dark and gaunt his black hair cut as short as bristles he had good eyes and a strikingly defined nose his teeth were as white as pearls and he had a carelessly aristocratic bearing he was the viscount [adolphe] {} ribbing [de] {be, he, me, re,

these counts ribbing [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} were of an old and noble family used to carrying on royal intrigues and to treat on equal terms with the powerful ones of earth it was a ribbing who rose in 1520 against the tyrant [christiern] {} who had caused his two children to be murdered there was a sad and melancholy legend in the family connected with the beheading of these two children the one aged twelve and the other only three the executioner had cut off the head of the eldest and had seized hold of the second to execute him too when the poor mite said in childish accents oh please do not soil my collar as you have soiled my brother [axel's] {} for mamma would scold me the executioner had two children of his own just the same ages as these moved by the words he flung down his sword and ran off overwhelmed with remorse [christiern] {} sent soldiers after him and he was killed [adolphe's] {} father with whom i have since become very friendly and who loves me like a father was then a man of fifty extremely distinguished in appearance with a charming nature although perhaps a little too sarcastic and of indomitable courage he had been educated at the military school in [berlin] {} and had come to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} when quite young as a captain in one of [louis] {louts} [xvi] {} 's foreign mercenary regiments those regiments which did him far more harm than any good their loyal services rendered him he had been presented to [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [antoinette] {} by the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [fersen] {} and under the patronage of that illustrious [favourite] {favorite} the queen gave him a most [favourable] {favorable} reception he remembered poor [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [antoinette] {} with most respectful veneration and thirty years after her death i often heard him speak of her with a voice full of tears he was recalled to [sweden] {} towards the close of the year 1791 he was betrothed to one of his cousins whom he [worshipped] {worshiped, worshiped} and intending to marry her on his return he [learnt] {learns, learn} on his arrival at [stockholm] {} that by the order of king [gustave] {} [iii] {} her hand had been disposed of and she was the wife of the count [d'essen] {} in his first transport of despair count ribbing provoked a quarrel with her husband a duel ensued and the count [d'essen] {} fell with a sword wound through his chest which kept him chained for six months to his bed [sweden] {} was greatly disturbed at this period the king insisted upon enforcing his diet to accept the deed of union and of security and at [geft] {deft, heft, left, weft, gift} the coup [d'état] {} took place which invested the king with sole power in the making of peace and war a tremendous strife had been waged for a long period between the regal power and the nobility though the king was married in 1766 to [sophie] {} [madeleine] {} of [denmark] {} he had no heir to his crown even in 1776 and the [swedish] {} nobility attributed the queen's sterility to the same cause as that of [louise] {louse} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [vaudemont] {} [henri] {} [iii] {} 's wife as in the case of the last of the house of [valois] {} [gustavus] {} had his [favourites] {favorites} and their familiarity with him led to their making the most extraordinary suggestions to their prince after a time the courtiers made up their minds to remonstrate with the king about the queen's barrenness and to tell him he ought to try to remedy this deficiency by every means in his power [gustavus] {} promised to see what could be done in the matter then so folks said a curious thing happened the evening of the day on which he had pledged his word to the [swedish] {} lords he took his [equerry] {} [monck] {mock, monk} to the queen's chamber and in the presence of the confused and blushing queen he explained to the [equerry] {} the service he required of him then he withdrew and shut the door of the royal chamber upon the pair some time later the queen's pregnancy was proclaimed and she gave birth to a prince who after his father's death reigned under the title of [gustavus] {} [iv] {id, if, in, is, it} until the [swedish] {} parliament proclaimed his deposition in 1809 i knew his son very well in [italy] {} where he [travelled] {traveled, traveled} under the name of the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [wasa] {wash, wasp, was} in 1770 [gustavus] {} [iii] {} then twenty four years of age came to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} as the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [haga] {raga, saga, hags, hag} he had an interview with a kind of sorceress who predicted future events in her hypnotic trances she had scarcely touched his hand before she told him to beware of the year 1792 as he would incur danger of death from firearms during the course of it [gustavus] {} was a brave man he had often exposed himself to danger he several times repeated the prediction laughingly but it never troubled him [inconsequence] {} of the diet of 1792 by which the nobles had lost the rest of their privileges there arose a conspiracy the principal ringleaders were [ankarström] {} count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} horn baron [d'erenswaerd] {} and colonel [lilienhorn] {} [ankarström] {} and ribbing had private reasons for hatred against the king besides the general grievances which embittered the aristocracy against the sovereign through the king's intervention [ankarström] {} had lost a lawsuit which had deprived him of half his fortune count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing as we have seen owed a grudge against the king for a far more grievous loss than that of a lawsuit namely the loss of his lady love in the case of the other nobles the projected murder of [gustavus] {} was simply an incident in the life of a clan they decided to perpetrate the murder at a masked ball which was to take place in the opera house on the night of 15 and 16 march 1792 on the night before the king received an anonymous letter warning him of the plot and telling him that he was to be assassinated on the following night ah yes said [gustavus] {} the very same thing was predicted twenty two years ago to the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [haga] {raga, saga, hags, hag} but he put no more faith in the prophecy than the king of [sweden] {} does to day and shrugging his shoulders he crumpled the note between his hands and threw it into the fireplace nevertheless people averred that [gustavus] {} went disguised on the night of the 14 15 to consult the famous sibyl [arfredson] {} who confirmed the french somnambulist's prediction and the warning contained in the anonymous letter telling him he would be murdered before three days had gone by whether from actual courage or from incredulity [gustavus] {} would not change any of his previously arranged plans nor take any precaution at eleven o'clock that night he went to the masked ball lots had been drawn the night before to settle which of the conspirators should kill the king and [gustavus] {} was so greatly detested by his nobles that each one was eager to have the dangerous [honour] {honor} of firing the fatal shot the lot was drawn by [ankarström] {} it is said that one of the conspirators offered to give him all the wealth he then possessed as well as all that which he was to inherit at a future date if he would change places with him but [ankarström] {} refused when the time came [ankarström] {} suddenly bethought him that he might mistake one of the nobles for the king as several of them were dressed in similar costumes but the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} horn reassured him fire boldly said he at the one to whom i shall say ' good day handsome masquerader ' he will be the king at two in the morning [gustavus] {} was strolling about leaning on the arm of the count [d'essen] {} whom he had married to [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [ribbing's] {} [fiancée] {fiancee, fiance} when the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} horn approached him and said good day handsome masquerader the next moment a dull report was heard and [gustavus] {} tottered crying out i am killed except those who were round about the king no one had perceived what had happened the pistol was concealed in a muff the report had been drowned [amidst] {midst} the buzz of conversation and the strains of the orchestra and the smoke remained buried in the muff but at the king's exclamation and on seeing him fall back fainting in the arms of [d'essen] {} everyone ran up in the commotion that followed it was quite easy for [ankarström] {} to put himself at a distance from the king and even to leave the hall but in his flight he dropped one of his pistols the pistol was picked up hot and still smoking next day every gun seller in [stockholm] {} was questioned and one of them [recognised] {recognized} the pistol as one he had sold to [ankarström] {} an hour later [ankarström] {} was arrested at his own house and a special commission was appointed to try him he confessed to but gloried in his crime as to his accomplices he declined under any conditions whatever to reveal their names the trial dragged on slowly it was hoped against hope that [ankarström] {} would give away the conspirators finally on 29 [april] {} 1792 forty four days after the murder he was condemned the sentence was that he was to be beaten with rods for three days then beheaded in spite of the length and the ignominy of the punishment [ankarström] {} remained firm to the very end while being taken in the cart to his execution he looked with perfect equanimity upon the thousands of spectators who thronged round the scaffold when he mounted the scaffold he asked for a few minutes in which to make his peace with god it was granted him he knelt down prayed and then gave himself up to the executioners he was not quite thirty three years of age ribbing who had been arrested at the same time as [ankarström] {} was but twenty one it was intended to condemn him to death like [ankarström] {} and the duke of [sudermania] {} regent over the kingdom during the minority of [gustavus] {} [iv] {id, if, in, is, it} was urging forward the trial when a mystic a disciple of [swedenborg] {} sought him out and told him that the master had appeared to him and had declared that not only was ribbing innocent but that every hair which fell from his head would cost a day of the life of the duke of [sudermania] {} the duke a [swedenborgian] {} himself was terrified at this warning and ribbing instead of sharing [ankarström's] {} fate was condemned to perpetual exile and as less could not be done for the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} horn and for [lilienhorn] {} than was done in the case of ribbing they both obtained the same [favour] {favor} the confiscation of their property followed upon the sentence of exile fortunately in the case of the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing the confiscation of property could not be put into execution until after the death of his mother she enjoyed the property in her own right during her lifetime and she was still quite young the count left for [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} where the revolution was then at its height and he arrived in time to witness the events of 2 and 3 [september] {} and 21 [january] {} his adoration for the queen made him loud in his denunciation of the events of those dreadful days he was arrested and although already a regicide was on the point of being delivered up to the revolutionary tribunal as too sympathetic with royal misfortunes when [chaumette] {} set him free gave him a passport and helped him to escape from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} the count then went to [switzerland] {} he was so young and so good looking that he went by the name of the beautiful regicide he was introduced to madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [staël] {stall} who took him much into her confidence the letters (some two or three [hundred)] {hundreds, hundred} which the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing received from madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [staël] {stall} during the lifetime of the illustrious [authoress] {} of [corinne] {} proved that this friendship was not of a temporary nature madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [staël] {stall} was surrounded by a circle of friends several of whom already knew the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing this little court was half political and half literary its chief purpose at that time was to rescue hide and protect emigrants against the persecutions of the magistrates in the [swiss] {swigs, swims, swish} cantons whose hands were continually being forced by the demands of the revolutionary government of [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} after 9 [thermidor] {} the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing could return to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} where he bought three or four [châteaux] {chateaux} and two or three abbeys at a very low price among these [châteaux] {chateaux} were [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} [brunoy] {} and [quincy] {quince} the count had acquired all these properties simply on the recommendations either of friends or of his solicitor [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} was among others quite unknown to him one day he made up his mind to pay a visit to the lovely estate people had praised so much unluckily the time was ill chosen for seeing all its charms the communal authorities of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} had handed over the [château] {chateau} to an association of shoemakers who made shoes for the army consequently the worthy disciples of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [crépin] {} had taken possession of the domain had set up their [workrooms] {} in the salons and in the bedrooms and the better to communicate with one another they had made openings through the ceilings when they had any oral communication to make they made it by means of these peep holes without having to leave their seats if they had to come up or downstairs to see one another they put ladders through these holes and so saved the turns and twists of the proper staircase one can imagine how greatly such tenants would detract from the appearance of the [château] {chateau} the count had just bought the sights and above all the smells about the place so disgusted him that he fled precipitately back to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} some days later he recounted his misadventure in his own witty way to m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} then connected with the commissariat department of the army m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} was more accustomed to the value of material goods than the noble exile and he then and there offered to take over his purchase m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing consented and [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} became from that moment the property of m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} happily the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing had still two or three other [châteaux] {chateaux} where he could reside instead of in the one he had just sold he chose [brunoy] {} which later he gave up to his friend [talma] {} as he had [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} to his friend [collard] {collars, collar, collared} and then he established himself in the [château] {chateau} of [quincy] {quince} during the whole of [napoleon's] {} reign the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing lived very quietly spending his winters in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and his summers in the country devoting himself to agriculture and to fishing in his ponds in which once he caught such an enormous pike that when it was put in the scales with [adolphe] {} at the other end the pike was actually the heavier [napoleon] {} offered m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing military positions more than once offers which he i declined on account of the conqueror's love of invasion fearing he might one day be compelled to carry arms against [sweden] {} on the second return of the [bourbons] {bourbon} to power their revenge for past political events pursued m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing to his private retreat he was obliged to exile himself again crossed the frontier and under an assumed name went to live in [brussels] {} with his wife and son but the incognito of the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing was soon to betray him under circumstances that will give some idea of his character in [brussels] {} the count found himself at the same table with some foreign officers who inflated with pride at the victory of [waterloo] {} abused [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} and [frenchmen] {} right and left one colonel who was covered with decorations especially distinguished himself by his exaggerated attacks the conversation was carried on in [german] {merman, germane} but as the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing had been brought up in [berlin] {} [german] {merman, germane} was almost like his mother tongue he did not therefore lose a single word of the conversation although he pretended he was not taking any notice suddenly he rose and advancing with his usual coolness to the colonel he slapped him right and left across the face accompanying the blows with a statement of his name and titles and then he quietly returned to his seat [cauchois] {} [lemaire] {} then only a young man was at the same table so was the poet [arnault] {} who was already an old man both at great risk to themselves offered their services to the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing as seconds happily these services were not required the colonel would not fight the roll of the thirty eight enriched [brussels] {} at the expense of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} [arnault] {} [excelmans] {} [regnault] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} saint [jean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} [d'angély] {} [cambacérès] {} [harel] {hazel, hared, harem, hares, hare} [cauchois] {} [lemaire] {} were all exiled m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing attached himself to them and with them founded [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [nain] {fain, gain, lain, main, pain} [jaune] {jaunt} a journal that soon earned itself a [european] {} reputation following upon an article published by the count in this journal the [prussian] {} government demanded that the author of it should be handed over to them this meant nothing less than imprisonment for life in a castle [prussia] {} is still as one knows the land of castles and it has long been the land of imprisonments however king [william] {} left the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing the choice of being delivered over to [prussia] {} or to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} somewhat after the fashion of the cook who gives a fowl its choice between being boiled or roasted m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing chose [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} he was taken prisoner flung into a post chaise with his son and driven to the borders of [condé] {condo} there he looked about him to discover from which of his old friends he could ask hospitality the nearest happened to be m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} so he took his way towards [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} it need hardly be said that he was received with open arms he had been living but three days in that lovely place changed so greatly since the days of the [bootmakers] {bookmakers} that it was almost beyond recognition when i met his son [adolphe] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} with madame [capelle] {} on his arm and

asked me to lunch with them next day in the forest to improve our acquaintance it was also arranged that following upon the lunch i should spend two or three days at the [château] {chateau} of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} of course i accepted the invitation the [fête] {fate, fete} of [corey] {covey, corny, cored, cores, core} was on the way with its delightful entertainments of dancing and merriment i can think of nothing more delightful than returning home at ten or eleven o'clock at night under the dense moving vault of the tall trees in the solemn stillness of the night it seemed like some ancient [elysium] {} with mute shades walking under in the darkness for the shades that pace our terrestrial [elysiums] {} speak so low so very low that we swear they are dumb i had been obliged to return to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to take back [ad&le] {addle} and to make her understand without hurting her feelings how important it was that i should maintain friendly intercourse with the [collard] {collars, collar, collared} family she was such an excellent good [hearted] {hearten, heated} straightforward girl that she soon understood and although feeling a little jealous at lending me to that group of aristocratic and beautiful young girls who were fine enough to inspire jealousy in the heart of a princess she gave me up for three days i set off at nine next morning to reach the arranged meeting place by ten o'clock everybody had spent the night at [corey] {covey, corny, cored, cores, core} at m [leroy's] {} house and i also should have done the same had i not been urgently recalled to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} by the necessity above

and now you are living at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} said i yes m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} is an old friend of my father how long shall you live here as long as the [bourbons] {bourbon} will allow us to remain in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} ah then you have fallen out with the [bourbons] {bourbon} too we have [quarrelled] {quarreled, quarreled} with most kings said [adolphe] {} with a laugh this phrase uttered with magnificent indifference quite finished me off luckily at that moment our fair companions appeared on the threshold of the farm a bevy of pink and white damsels two or three chars à [bancs] {bands, banes, bangs, banks, banns} were in readiness to take them to the appointed place the gentlemen were to go on foot the rendezvous was barely a quarter of a league's distance from the village a long table of thirty covers was laid under a leafy canopy ten paces off a limpid clear purling spring called the [fontaine] {} [aux] {tux, auk, ax} princes all these young folks maidens mothers children seemed like so many woodland flowers opening to the sweet breathed breeze some pale that sought for shade and solitude others of brilliant hues seeking light and stir and the sunshine of admiration oh those glorious woods those shady depths the haunts of my cherished moods of solitude i have revisited you since but no shade glides now beneath your green vaults and in your dark alleys what have you done with all that delightful world which vanished with my youth why have not other generations come in their turn pale or rosy lively or careless noisy or silent like ours has that ephemeral [efflorescence] {} disappeared for ever is it really wanting or is it that my eyes have lost the power of seeing we returned that night to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} everything was so beautifully arranged in that luxurious little [château] {chateau} that each of us had a separate room and bed and sometimes there were as many as thirty or forty of us there i have related what nocturnal persecutions poor [hiraux] {} was made a victim of when he came to see us at [les] {hes, mes, yes, lbs, lea} [fossés] {} it was now our turn to undergo the like our rooms were prepared beforehand for the pantomime that followed the family doctor [manceau] {} was the stage manager he had replaced an old doctor from [soissons] {} named m [paroisse] {} i will explain presently why this change took place the assistant stage managers were [louise] {louse} [cécile] {} and [augustine] {} the appointed victims were [hippolyte] {} [leroy] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} and myself [hippolyte] {} [leroy] {} was at this period a young man of between twenty five and twenty six he was a cousin of m [leroy] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [corey] {covey, corny, cored, cores, core} he had been one of the body guard and was now secretary to the inspection at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} later he became my cousin by his marriage with [augustine] {} [deviolaine] {} our three rooms communicated with one another we retired to our rooms about half past twelve [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} was the first to get into bed he had scarcely lain down before he began to complain of a most intolerable tickling his bed was sprinkled with the stuff charlatans sell which they call scratching powder those unacquainted with this powder should recall the famous scene in [robert] {} [macaire] {macabre} where the two heroes of the book find a trunk and in that trunk a quantity of tiny packets containing some unknown substance whose property was revealed when they touched it in about five [minutes'] {minutest, minutes} time [adolphe] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} began to scratch himself like both [robert] {} [macaire] {macabre} and [bertrand] {} put together we offered [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} our sincere sympathy we advised him to rub it off as best he could to wrap himself in his bed curtain and to sleep on a couch then we went to our own beds quite convinced that we should find them like [adolphe's] {} but we searched them in vain they seemed perfectly free from any preparation of the like nature we lay down in five [minutes'] {minutest, minutes} time [hippolyte] {} [leroy] {} uttered a sharp cry in stretching himself he felt a piece of string at the foot of the bed he pulled this thread and in doing so he untied a bag full of frogs the frogs gaining their liberty hastened to disport themselves about the bed and it was the contact of his human flesh with their animal hide which produced [hippolyte's] {} yell above mentioned he flung off the bed clothes and [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} out of bed the frogs leaped out after him he had been given good measure there were quite two dozen of them i was beginning to think i was the only one spared when i thought i heard a great stirring inside a cupboard against which the head of my bed had been put i looked at the lock it was [keyless] {} however i felt no doubt that some sort of animal was shut up in that cupboard only what sort of an animal was it i was not kept long in suspense as one o'clock struck a cock crowed at the head of my bed and renewed his crowing every hour till day came i did not deny [christ] {} like [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} peter but i confess i took his name in vain we fell asleep by seven o'clock [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} in spite of his itching powder [hippolyte] {} [leroy] {} in spite of his frogs and i in spite of my cock when [manceau] {} entered our rooms and woke us by telling us that as he had heard in roundabout ways we had spent a bad night he had come to offer us his professional services [manceau] {} denounced his own handiwork we had slept so badly through that horrible night that with terrible imprecations we had consigned our persecutor whoever he might be to the infernal regions [manceau] {} as i have said denounced himself expiation must follow the crime our sworn oath must be fulfilled at a sign [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} shut the door i fell upon [manceau] {} [hippolyte] {} gagged him we stripped him naked we wrapped him in a sheet off [adolphe's] {} bed we tied him up like a sausage we took him down a disused staircase and we deposited him in the most unfrequented part of the park in the very middle of the little river at a place where he could stand but where entangled as he was he ran great risk of losing his foothold at the first step he took we then quietly returned to our beds and resumed our interrupted sleep we went down to the morning meal at ten o'clock our arrival was eagerly expected everybody burst out laughing when we came within view the young ladies each played a part some pretended to scratch others imitated in a low voice the croaking of frogs and others simulated the crowing of a cock we were quite imperturbable we merely asked carelessly where [manceau] {} was nobody had seen him we sat down to table the fowl was tough [cécile] {} remarked one would have said it was an old cock which had crowed all the night [augustine] {} asked where the frogs were that she had seen she said in the kitchen the night before had they been moved were the frogs lost the frogs must be found again [louise] {louse} asked [adolphe] {} if he was not attacked by a contagious affection for since he had offered her his arm to lead her into the dining room her skin had felt fearfully irritable if [manceau] {} were here i said to [louise] {louse} you could ask him for a prescription to allay it but joking apart where is [manceau] {} asked madame [collard] {collars, collar, collared} silence again as at the first inquiry matters were becoming serious and folks began to be uneasy about the dear doctor it was not his custom to absent himself at meal times they sent to ask the porter if [manceau] {} had gone out to attend some sick person in the village the porter had not seen [manceau] {} i believe he is drowned i said poor fellow why should he be asked madame [collard] {collars, collar, collared} because yesterday evening he proposed a bathing party to us but we slept so well we missed meeting him in his room as arranged as we did not turn up he must have gone alone to bathe oh good gracious exclaimed madame [collard] {collars, collar, collared} the poor doctor he cannot swim a chorus of lamentations went up from the ladies at these words by the side of which the wailing of the [israelites] {} in exile was a trifle it was settled that [manceau] {} should be searched for immediately after the meal was over good said [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} in a whisper to me i will take the opportunity while everybody is out to write my verses in [louise's] {louse's} album and i i replied i will stand sentinel at the door to prevent your being disturbed everything happened as had been arranged the whole beehive of the castle swarmed into the garden the older men m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} the father m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} m [méchin] {} stayed in the drawing room to read the newspapers [hippolyte] {} played billiards with [maurice] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} and i went upstairs to [louise's] {louse's} room which was next to m [collard's] {collar's} and whilst i watched on the landing he wrote his four lines in the album he had scarcely finished the last when we heard loud shouts and upon going to look out of the window we saw [louise] {louse} and [augustine] {} running towards the castle [cécile] {} who was braver had remained stoutly where she was and had looked towards the river with more curiosity than alarm bravo said i to [adolphe] {} [manceau] {} has made his appearance we quickly went down a ghost a ghost cried [louise] {louse} and [augustine] {} there is a ghost in the river oh my god said [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} can it be that the spirit of poor [manceau] {} is already borne down below it was not his spirit but his body by dint of struggling with his cords [manceau] {} had freed one arm then both his two arms freed he had taken the handkerchief off his mouth when [ungagged] {} he had called out for help unfortunately the gardener was at the opposite end of the garden he had tried hard to untie the cords which bound his legs as he had done those binding his hands but to do so he would have to put his head under the water and as madame [capelle] {} had said the unlucky doctor did not know how to swim and was restrained from any such attempt by the fear of being suffocated at last his cries attracted the attention of the young girls but at sight of the figure wrapped in a sheet and making despairing gesticulations fear had taken possession of them and not having the least notion that [manceau] {} would be discovered in the middle of the river shrouded in such a garment they had shrieked at the apparition and had flown away they sent to the unhappy [manceau] {} the gardener for whom he had called so loudly he [clamoured] {glamoured, clamored} vehemently for his clothes he had been in the river from seven in the morning until noon and although it was towards the end of [july] {duly, jury} the bath was infinitely too protracted and had made him somewhat chilly he was put to bed with a hot bottle from that moment [manceau] {} was the object of general pity and we of universal [execration] {} for god be merciful to him a sinner [manceau] {} had been cowardly enough to denounce us it was in vain for [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} to show his hands as red as crabs and to offer to show the rest of his body which was as red as his hands in vain did [hippolyte] {} collect the frogs scattered about his room and bring them into the drawing room in vain did i fetch the cock with which i had held discourse all the night from the barnyard nothing moved our judges we were banished from society for deliberate attempted homicide in the matter of doctor [manceau] {} so we promised ourselves to drown him out and out the first chance we got banished from the society of the ladies i took refuge in the [billiard] {billiards} room where [maurice] {} gave me my first lesson in billiards we shall see that this lesson stood me in good stead and that four years later at a solemn occasion in my life i [practised] {practiced} the art of cannoning wherein i had made some progress our punishment lasted throughout that evening which the young ladies spent in [louise's] {louse's} room as it was raining [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} made several attempts to get into that chamber but was repulsed each time a great change had come over him since four o'clock in the afternoon after a conversation he had had with his father in which the elder man had seemed to me to sneer at him strangely [adolphe] {} grew very restless almost gloomy and although he was [determinedly] {} kept out of [louise's] {louse's} room where she was holding a gathering of her girl friends as i have mentioned he went back persistently again and again ah i see i said to myself after a moment's reflection he wants to obtain news of his quatrain and to know how it has succeeded and satisfied with my reasoning i did not look any farther for the cause of [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven's] {leaven's} insistence but i regretted i had not the means with which partial nature had endowed [adolphe] {} to cause my shortcomings to be forgiven i was pursued by this regret when in [hippolyte's] {} room where we withdrew questioning each other what had become of [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} who had not been seen for an hour when suddenly we heard a great noise in the midst of which we could make out the words stop thief echoing through the castle as we were still dressed we dashed out of our room and quickly descended the staircase at the foot of the staircase was m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} in his nightshirt holding [adolphe] {} by his coat collar it was an extraordinary sight m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} looked furious and [adolphe] {} exceedingly penitent in the meantime m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} who had not yet gone to bed arrived on the scene as imperturbable as ever his hands in his trousers pockets chewing a toothpick after his usual fashion this toothpick was an indispensable item in m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven's] {leaven's} life well well what is the matter now [collard] {collars, collar, collared} what have you against my boy what have i what have i shrieked m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} growing more and more exasperated i have something that cannot be overlooked ah what has he done then what has he done [i'll] {ill, it'll} tell you what he has done forgive me father said [adolphe] {} trying to get in a word or two of justification forgive me father but m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} is mistaken he believes hold your tongue you scoundrel yelled m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} kicking him then turning to the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing he said listen my dear [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} and i will tell you where i have found this son of yours but i must protest dear m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} it was solely and simply to be quiet interrupted m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} come with us you shall clear yourself if you can oh said [adolphe] {} that will not be difficult we shall see pushing the youth before him he signed to the count to go inside his room and following himself shut the door and double locked it we withdrew in silence [hippolyte] {} myself and the other spectators of that curious scene [adolphe] {} returned at the end of a quarter of an hour he looked so crestfallen that we dared not question him for details we went to bed in ignorance of the cause of all the disturbance but after [hippolyte] {} had fallen asleep [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} came to me and told me the whole story this was what had happened as i have said above [adolphe] {} had written the wonderful quatrain in [louise's] {louse's} album that morning when it was finished he left the young lady's room as fast as possible towards four o'clock [adolphe] {} who had not been able to contain the news drew his father aside and repeated his quatrain to him m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing listened gravely until the last syllable of the fourth line and then he said say it over again please [adolphe] {} repeated it obediently [pourquoi] {} [dans] {bans, cans, fans, mans, pans} la [froide] {} [ibérie] {} [louise] {louse} [ensevelir] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [si] {hi, mi, pi, ti, sh} [charmants] {} [attraits]

mistaken the south for the north [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} for [russia] {} oh cried [adolphe] {} aghast upon my word so i have i have put [ibérie] {} for [sibérie] {} i understand said the count it makes a better rhyme but is less accurate and shrugging his shoulders he went off humming a little air and chewing his toothpick [adolphe] {} stood dumbfounded he had signed his unlucky quatrain with his full name if the album were opened and the quatrain were read he would be disgraced this sword of [damocles] {} hung over the unlucky poet's head had distracted him all the evening it was to get hold of [louise's] {louse's} album that he had made the obstinate efforts to enter her room i have detailed but as we have seen his attempts had been fruitless when night came [adolphe] {} took a desperate resolve he would go into [louise's] {louse's} room when she was asleep seize her album and destroy the tell tale page this resolution he put into execution about eleven o'clock the door opened without creaking too much and [adolphe] {} who squeezed himself through as softly as possible on tiptoe with but the one end one hope and one desire of reaching the album had thus invaded his young friend's maiden chamber all went well as far as the album it was on the table and [adolphe] {} took it put it in his vest determined to regain possession by hook or by crook of the four lines which had made their author so unhappy when suddenly he ran against a little table which fell and in falling awakened [louise] {louse} [louise] {louse} startled cried out thief thief at the cry of thief thief m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} whose room adjoined his daughter's rushed out of bed in his nightshirt flung himself on [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} on the landing collared him and as we have seen suspecting poor innocent [adolphe] {} of quite another crime dragged him into his chamber his father followed them and closed the door behind him there everything was explained thanks to the album which [adolphe] {} had been careful not to let go m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} was convinced [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [visu] {visa, vise} of the geographical error [adolphe] {} had committed he thoroughly understood the importance of that error and reassured in the matter of motive he was soon satisfied about the deed so neither [louise's] {louse's} reputation nor [adolphe's] {} suffered any blemish from this occurrence as they continued to punish [hippolyte] {} and me next day for [manceau's] {} little adventure we left [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} without saying a word to anyone and took the road to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} strange to say i have never re entered [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} since the young [girls'] {girls} ostracism lasted thirty years only once have i since seen

never saw either madame [collard] {collars, collar, collared} or madame [capelle] {} again both are now dead but when i close my eyes in spite of those thirty years of absence i can still see them all the dead and the living i promised to tell the story of the old doctor who was [manceau's] {} predecessor and it would be unfair to my readers to break my word m [paroisse] {} lived at [soissons] {} a thinly scattered practice allowed him to dine once a week at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} where he was always made heartily welcome this lasted for ten years one day m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} received a large manuscript signed by the worthy doctor it was the bill for his visits he had charged twenty francs for each visit and the sum total was something alarming m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} paid him but told m [paroisse] {} from henceforth not to come to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} unless he were specially sent for it was in consequence of this incident that [manceau] {} was installed in the castle as the regular medical attendant to the family i forget what became of [manceau] {} i fancy the poor devil is dead happily this was not in consequence of the enforced bath we gave him chapter v [amédée] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence,

which i escaped after the unjust sentence that was passed upon us in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} i returned to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and disgusted with my sojourn in the aristocratic regions whence i had just been cast forth i returned with delight to the world i preferred to theirs wherein i could find complete satisfaction for all my heart longings and all my proud cravings [adèle] {addle} at first received me back very coldly and i had to endure a fit of the sulks for some hours at the end of that time little by little her pretty face cleared and she ended by smiling upon me with the freshness and sweetness of an opening flower one might have said of this lovely child that her smile itself was like a rose while these youthful love affairs were in progress all of them alas of the ephemeral character of love at sixteen there were friendships taking root in my heart that were to last the whole of my life i have already spoken of [adolphe] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} who suddenly took a prominent place in my life apart from my childish friendships here let me also be allowed to say a word about another friend who was to finish in certain other directions the work of opening out future vistas before me that had been begun by the son of count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing one day we saw a young man of twenty six or twenty seven go along the streets of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} wearing the uniform of an officer of hussars with an unusually stately grace no one could possibly have been handsomer or more distinguished in appearance than this young man his face perhaps might have been [criticised] {criticized} as a trifle too feminine looking if it had not been for a fine sword cut which without spoiling in any way the regularity of his features began at the left side of his forehead and ended at the right corner of his upper lip adding a touch of manliness and courage to his gentle features his name was [amédée] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} i do not know what chance or whim or necessity led him to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} had he come as an idle tourist to spend his income of five or six thousand [livres] {lives} in our town i do not know it is probable he liked the country he stayed among us and at the end of a year of residence he became the husband of a charmingly pretty young girl [louise] {louse} [moreau] {} a friend of my sister they had a beautiful fair haired child whom i should much like to see to day we nicknamed it [mouton] {} on account of its gentleness the whiteness of its skin and its flaxen hair i lost sight of you such a long while ago my dear [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} whatever part of the world you may be in if you read these pages you will find therein a testimony of my ever living sincere and lasting friendship for you for my friend you did a great deal for me you said to me believe me my dear boy there are other things in life besides pleasure and love hunting and dancing and the silly ambitions of youth there is work learn to work that is the true way to be happy and you were right dear friend apart from the death of my father the death of my mother and the death of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} how is it i have never experienced a sorrow that i have not crushed beneath my feet or a disappointment that i have not overcome it is because you introduced me to the only friend who can give comfort by day and by night who is ever near who hastens to console at the first sigh who lends healing balm at the first tear you made me acquainted with work o dear and most excellent work thou who [bearest] {dearest, nearest, barest} in thy strong arms that heavy burden of humanity which we call sorrow thou divinity with hand ever stretched open and with face ever smiling oh dear and most excellent work thou [hast] {bast, cast, east, fast, last} never cast the shadow of deception on me my blessings upon thee o work [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} spoke [italian] {} and [german] {merman, germane} as fluently as his own language he offered to teach them to me in

outside of the cup of bitter drink given to a sick child one of the books out of which i [learnt] {learns, learn} [italian] {} was [ugo] {ago, ego, ugh, go} [foscolo's] {} fine novel which i have since translated under the title of the last letters of [jacopo] {} [ortis] {} that book gave me an idea of an insight into and a feeling for romantic literature of which previously i had been totally ignorant in two [months'] {months} time i could talk [italian] {} fairly correctly and i began to translate poetry i much preferred this to my sales and my marriage contracts and the drawing up of bonds and transfers at [maître] {} [mennesson's] {} furthermore a change took place in the office greatly to the advantage of my literary education but not to my legal education [niguet] {} that precious head clerk who had told tales to m [mennesson] {} of my love disappointments had bought in a [neighbouring] {neighboring} village a lawyer's practice which i believe [lafarge] {} had been obliged to sell as he had not been able to find the wherewithal to take it up and [paillet] {pallet} a friend of mine who was six or eight years my senior had succeeded [niguet] {} as head clerk over me [paillet] {pallet} was well to do he had a delightful property two leagues from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} his tastes were luxurious consequently he let me off more readily than [niguet] {} (who was an old [basochian[1]] {} without any fun in him and entirely wrapped up in his [business)] {business} to pursue the simple luxuries i could indulge in namely shooting flirting and dancing so it came about that instead of encouraging me in treading the narrow and difficult path of a provincial solicitor [paillet] {pallet} allowed me to cast my eyes abroad instinctively understanding doubtless that the work they had put me to was not what i was cut out for it can easily be seen that [paillet] {pallet} exercised material influence over my future destiny apart from the moral influence exercised by [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} and [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} i was then perfectly happy in the love of my mother and in a younger and sweeter love growing up side by side with hers without injuring it and in the friendship of [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} and of [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paillet] {pallet} when [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} came to complete my happiness i lacked nothing save that golden mean of which [horace] {} speaks had i had that too i should have had scarcely aught to wish for suddenly we heard that m [deviolaine] {} was going to retire with his family to his estate of saint [remy] {rely} and let his house at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing so the house wherein i had been brought up the house peopled for me with a host of memories was to pass from the hands of a relative into the hands of a friend the beautiful garden had taken m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven's] {leaven's} special fancy he hoped to give vent in it to his hobby for gardening interrupted by the successive sales of [brunoy] {} and [quincy] {quince} furthermore the count had not met with any more persecution and whether it was because [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} did not know of his being in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} or whether the king closed his eyes to the fact he was left in undisturbed peacefulness [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} and his father settled then in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} where madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} joined them in a

i have mentioned into a shooting range and every day we used up twenty or thirty balls [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} had excellent [german] {merman, germane} pistols ( [kukenreiter] {} ) these pistols were [marvellously] {marvelously, marvelously} true and we soon were able to shoot with such precision all three of us that when anyone doubted our powers we would take it in turn to hold the piece of cardboard which served as a target whilst the others fired and we never any of us received a single graze i remember one day after heavy rain we found i do not know how many frogs in that gloomy damp courtyard here was novel game for us to pot at and we exterminated every frog with our pistols every little while [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} read us a fable or an elegy of his own composition but he was cured of making geographical errors by the nocturnal misadventure at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [hellon] {hellos, hello, hellion} and no

repartee he could strike as rapidly at his object as the most accomplished fencing master could parry a blow or deal a right handed stroke the only fault one could find with this wit was its keen biting edge but like bites made by healthy teeth the poet's bites never left poison behind them m [arnault] {} had made the acquaintance of the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} ribbing at that famous table [d'hôte] {} where the latter had struck the foreign colonel in the face since that day m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} [frenchman] {} at heart and m [arnault] {} [frenchman] {} in

memories of visits to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} one in 1806 the other in 1814 these two recollections sufficed to make me passionately envious of the lot of every [favoured] {favored} being who was going to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i remained behind with [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} and i redoubled my devotion to the study of [italian] {} i was soon sufficiently far advanced in the language of [dante] {dance, ante, date} and of [ariosto] {} to be able to pass on to that of [schiller] {chiller} and of [goethe] {} but this was quite a different matter after three or four [months'] {months} work [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} put one of [auguste] {august, auguster} [lafontaine's] {} novels in my way the task was too difficult i soon had enough of it [german] {merman, germane} was dropped and i have never had the courage to take it up again my first serious dramatic impression dates from this period some nabob who had done business through m [mennesson] {} out of unheard of generosity left a hundred and fifty francs to be divided among the lads in the office m [mennesson] {} distributed it in the following way thirty seven francs fifty cents each to [ronsin] {rosin} and myself seventy five francs to [paillet] {pallet} it was the first time i had found myself possessed of so much money i wondered what i should do with it one of the four great [fêtes] {fates, fetes} of the year was approaching when we should have [sunday] {sundry, sundae} and [monday] {} as holidays [paillet] {pallet} proposed we should both club our thirty seven francs fifty cents to his seventy five francs and that we should go and sink this fabulous sum of fifty crowns in the delights that [soissons] {} the seat of the [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} prefecture could offer us the suggestion was hailed with joy [paillet] {pallet} was deputed cashier and we boldly took seats on the diligence for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} which passes through [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} at half past three in the morning and arrives at [soissons] {} at six o'clock [paillet] {pallet} and [ronsin] {rosin} each took a place in the [coupé] {coupe, coups, coup} where one was already taken and i went inside where there were four other passengers three of whom got out at la [vertefeuille] {} a post three leagues away from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} the fourth continuing his journey to [soissons] {} from la [vertefeuille] {} to [soissons] {} therefore i was left alone with this person who was a man of forty years or thereabouts very thin of body pale of face with auburn hair and well groomed he had laid great stress on my sitting near him and in order to leave me as much room as possible squeezed himself as closely into a corner of the coach as he could i was much touched by this attention and felt sensibly drawn to the gentleman who had condescended to treat me with so much consideration i slept well and anywhere in those days so as soon as we got out of the town i fell asleep only to wake when the horses were changed and i should most certainly not have waked up then if the three passengers who left us had not trodden on my toes as they got out with the habitual heavy footed tread [travellers] {travelers, travelers} indulge in at the expense of those who remain behind when the passenger saw i was awake he began to talk to me and asked me in a kindly interested way my age my name and my occupation i made haste to supply him with full particulars and he seemed much interested therein i told him the object of our journey to [soissons] {} and as i coughed while i related my tale he good [naturedly] {} offered me two different sorts of cough lozenges i accepted both and in order to get the full benefit of them i put them both in my mouth together then although i found the gentleman's conversation agreeable and his manners fascinating there was something even more seductive and pleasing than that conversation and those manners namely sleep so i wished him a good night and with plenty of room to dispose myself in i settled down in the corner parallel with his with my back upon one seat and my feet on the other i do not know how long i had slept when i felt myself awakened in the oddest fashion in the world my sleeping fellow [traveller] {traveler, traveler} had apparently passed from mere interest to a more lively expression of his sentiments and was embracing me i imagined he had a nightmare and i tried to awake him but as i saw that the more soundly he slept the worse his gesticulations became i began to strike him hard and as my blows had no effect i cried aloud with all my might unluckily they were descending the hill of [vaubuin] {} and they could not stop the coach the struggle therefore lasted ten minutes or more and without in the least knowing what danger i was combating i was just about to succeed in getting the better of my enemy by turning him over under my knee when the door opened and the conductor came to my rescue [paillet] {pallet} and [ronsin] {rosin} were sleeping as i should have slept if my [travelling] {traveling, traveling} companion had not waked me up by his overpowering friendliness i told the conductor what had happened and blamed him for having put me along with a somnambulist or a madman begging him to put me in any other corner of the coach convenient to him when to my intense astonishment whilst the [traveller] {traveler, traveler} was readjusting his toilet which had been considerably damaged by my struggle with him without uttering any sort of complaint against me the conductor began [apostrophising] {} him in the severest terms made him get down out of the coach and told him that as there only remained three quarters of a league from where we were to the [hôtel] {hotel} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [trois] {trots, troys} [pucelles] {} where the coach stopped he must have the goodness to do it on foot unless he would consent to mount up on the roof where he could not disturb anybody else the gentleman of the auburn locks hoisted himself on the roof without opening his lips and the diligence started off again although i was now alone once more and consequently more at my ease inside the coach i was too much excited by the struggle i had just gone through to think of going to sleep again i could hear the conductor in the [cabriolet] {} relate my story to my two fellow [travelling] {traveling, traveling} companions and apparently he presented it to them under a gayer light than that in which i had looked at it myself for they roared with laughter i did not know what there could be to laugh at in an interchange of fisticuffs with a somnambulist or a maniac a quarter of an hour after the gentleman had been installed on the imperial and i reinstated in the carriage i heard by the heavy sound of the coach wheels that we were crossing under the drawbridge we had reached our destination five minutes after we had left the coach [paillet] {pallet} and [ronsin] {rosin} told me why they had laughed and it sounded so ridiculous that i rushed off in search of my gentleman of the cough lozenges almost before they had finished but i searched the imperial in vain in every corner and cranny he had disappeared this nocturnal struggle upset me so greatly that i felt dazed the whole of the day [1] translator's note member of the society of law clerks chapter [vi] {hi, mi, pi, ti, vs} first dramatic impressions the hamlet of [ducis] {ducks, ducts} the [bourbons] {bourbon} [en] {an, in, on, ea, ed} 1815 quotations from it among the pleasures we had promised ourselves in the second capital of the department of [aisne] {aisle} we had put the [theatre] {} in the first rank a company of pupils from the [conservatoire] {} who were touring in the provinces were that night to give a special performance of [ducis's] {} hamlet i had absolutely no idea who hamlet was i will go farther and admit that i was completely ignorant who was [ducis] {ducks, ducts} no one could have been more ignorant than i was my poor mother had tried to induce me to read [corneille's] {} and [racine's] {rapine's, ravine's, racing's, raciness} tragedies but i confess it to my shame the reading of them had bored me [inexpressibly] {inexpressible} i had no notion at that time what was meant by style or form or structure i was a child of nature in the fullest acceptance of the term what amused me i thought good what wearied me bad so i read the word tragedy on the placard with some misgivings but after all as this tragedy was the best that [soissons] {} had to offer us to pass away the evening we put ourselves in the queue waiting outside in good time and in spite of the great crowd we succeeded in getting into the pit something like thirty two years have rolled by since that night but such an impression did it make upon my mind that i can still remember every little detail connected with it the young fellow who took the part of hamlet was a tall pale sallow youth called [cudot] {} he had fine eyes and a strong voice and he imitated [talma] {} so closely that when i saw [talma] {} act the same part i almost thought he imitated [cudot] {} as i have said the subject of literature was completely unknown to me i did not even know that there had ever existed an author named [shakespeare] {} and when on my return i was instructed by [paillet] {pallet} that hamlet was only an imitation i pronounced before my sister who knew [english] {} the name of the author of [romeo] {rodeo} and of [macbeth] {} as i had seen it written and it cost me one of those prolonged [jokings] {joking} my sister [never'] {never} spared me when occasion offered of course on this occasion i delighted her now as the hamlet of [ducis] {ducks, ducts} could not lose in my estimation by comparison since i had never heard [shakespeare's] {} spoken of the play seemed to me with hamlet's grotesque entrance the ghost visible only to himself his struggle against his mother his urn his monologue the gloomy [questionings] {questioning} concerning the fear of death to be a masterpiece and produced an immense effect upon me so when i returned to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} the first thing i did was to collect together the few francs left over from the trip to [soissons] {} and to write to [fourcade] {} (who had given up his place to [camusat] {} of whom i spoke in connection with old [hiraux] {} and who had returned to [paris)] {parish} to send me the tragedy of hamlet for some reason or other [fourcade] {} delayed sending it to me for five or six days so great was my impatience that i wrote him a second letter filled with the keenest reproaches at his negligence and want of friendliness [fourcade] {} who would never have believed anyone could accuse a man of being a poor friend because he did not hurry over sending hamlet sent me a charming letter the gist of which i did not appreciate until i had studied more deeply the question of what was good and what was bad and was able to place [ducis's] {} work in its due rank in the meantime i became demented i asked everybody do you know hamlet do you know [ducis] {ducks, ducts} the tragedy arrived from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} at the end of three days i knew the part of hamlet by heart and worse still i have such an excellent memory that i have never been able to forget it so it came to pass that hamlet was the first dramatic work which produced an impression upon me a profound impression composed of inexplicable sensations aimless longings mysterious rays of light which only made my darkness more visible later in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i again saw poor [cudot] {} who had played hamlet alas the grand talent that had carried me away had not obtained him the smallest foothold and i believe he has long since given up hope that daughter of pride so hard to kill in the artist's soul the hope of making a position on the stage now as if the spirit of poetry when wakened in me had sworn never to go to sleep again and used every means to that end by even succeeding in making [maître] {} [mennesson] {} himself his accomplice scarcely had i returned from [soissons] {} when instead of giving me a deed of sale to copy out or a bond to engross or sending me out on business [maître] {} [mennesson] {} gave me a piece of poetry of which he wanted three copies made this piece of poetry was entitled [les] {hes, mes, yes, lbs, lea} [bourbons] {bourbon} [en] {an, in, on, ea, ed} 1815 m [mennesson] {} as i have said was a republican i found him a republican in 1830 and when i saw him again in 1848 he was still a republican and to do him justice he had the courage of his opinions through all times and under all regimes so freely did he express his opinions that his friends were frightened by them and made their observations thereon with bated breath he only shrugged his shoulders what the devil will they do to me he would exclaim my office is paid for my [clientèle] {clientele} flourishing i defy them to find a flaw in any of my contracts and that being the case one can afford to mock at kings and parsons [maître] {} [mennesson] {} was right too for in spite of all these demonstrations all these accusations of imprudence made by timid souls his practice was the best in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and improved daily at this very moment he was in the seventh heaven of delight he had got hold of a piece of poetry in manuscript against the [bourbons] {bourbon} i do not know how he had read it to everybody in the town and then after reading it to everybody when i came back from [soissons] {} he as i have said ordered me to make two or three copies of it for those of his friends who like himself were anxious to possess this poetical pamphlet i have never seen it in print i have never read it since the day i copied it out three times but such is my memory that i can repeat it from beginning to end but lest i alarm my readers i will content myself with quoting a few lines of it this was how it began

expression of the desires of the few miscarries and spends its fury but which the moment it becomes the expression of general requirements swallows up thrones and nations kings and royal families it is easy to understand how the [messéniennes] {} of [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} which appeared in print the same time as these manuscript pamphlets seemed pale and [colourless] {colorless} [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was one of those men who celebrate in song revolutions that were accomplished facts but who do not help revolutions in the making the [maubreuil] {} trial was the outcome of the piece of poetry from which i have just quoted these brief extracts a most mysterious and ill [omened] {opened} business in which names if not the most illustrious in [europe] {} yet at least the best known at that time were mixed up with acts of thievery and premeditated assassination probably i am the only person in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} who now thinks of the [affaire] {affairs, affair} [maubreuil] {} perhaps also i am the only person who has kept a shorthand account of the sittings of that terrible trial during which the horrors of the dungeon and secret torture

{maria, mare, marine} [louise] {louse} should stay in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} a pale and cold smile flitted over the vast chasm which served the [diplomatist] {} for a mouth i knew

empress's women could have been seen in the dubious light of the growing dawn by the still more dubious light of lamps and dying candles running about pale with fatigue and fear after a whole night spent in preparing for the journey the departure as we have said was fixed for nine o'clock at ten o'clock the empress had not yet left her apartments she was hoping to the last that a counter order would arrive either from the emperor or from [joseph] {} at half past ten the king of [rome] {come, dome, home, some, tome} clung to the curtains of the [palais] {} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [tuileries] {} in tears for he too poor child did not want to go alas at a distance of seventeen years between three children all suffering through the mistakes of their fathers clung in vain to those

stepped into a carriage with the king of [rome] {come, dome, home, some, tome} surrounded by a strong detachment of the imperial guard on the same day and at the same hour the emperor set off from [troyes] {tropes, troys} for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} with his flying squadrons it is well known that the emperor was arrested at [fromenteau] {} but what follows is not known or but imperfectly known when time and occasion serve apropos of the [july] {duly, jury} revolution probably we shall revert to one of the men whom fate for some unknown reason branded with a fatal seal we refer to [marmont] {marmot} we will show what he was rather than what he did he was superb during that retreat in which he left neither gun nor prisoner in the hands of the enemy superb when like a lion at bay against the walls of the [customhouse] {} at [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} surrounded by [russians] {} and [prussians] {} in the main street of [belleville] {} his right arm still in a sling after the battle of [arapiles] {} holding his sword in his left hand mutilated at [leipzig] {} his clothes riddled with bullets wedged in between the dead and the wounded who fell all round him with only forty grenadiers behind him he forced his way to the barrier where he abandoned pierced with wounds the fifth horse that had been killed under him since the beginning of the campaign alas why did he not cross [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} from the barrier of [belleville] {} to the barrier of [fontainebleau] {} why did he stop at his house in the rue [paradis] {parades, paradise} [poissonnière] {} why did he not go to [napoleon] {} with his coat in shreds and his face blackened with powder how [determinedly] {} fate seemed to oppose him how different would have been the verdict of the future but we who are now a part of that future and well nigh disinterested spectators of all those great events we who by nature are without private hatreds and by position have nothing to do with political animosities it is for us to enlighten posterity for we are poised between the worlds aristocratic and democratic the one in its decadence and the other in its adolescence it is ours to seek for truth wherever it may be buried and to exalt it wherever it may be found and now having defined our position let us return to [napoleon] {} and [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [louise] {louse} let us pass over several days and say naught of great betrayals and shameful [dishonour] {dishonor} even so we are not unhappily at the end of these things from 29 march to 7 [april] {} the following events happened on 30 march [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} capitulated on the 31st the allied armies entered the capital on i [april] {} the senate appointed a provisional government on the 2nd the senate declared [napoleon] {} to have forfeited the throne on the 3rd the legislative body confirmed the forfeiture on the 4th [napoleon] {} abdicated in [favour] {favor} of his son on the 5th [marmont] {marmot} treated with the enemy on the 6th the senate drew up a scheme for a constitution on the 7 [th] {ah, ch, eh, oh, sh} the troops of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [raguse] {} rose in insurrection and refused to obey his orders also [napoleon] {} made his plans for withdrawing across the [loire] {moire, lire,

learn} in rapid succession the declaration of dethronement by the senate the emperor's first abdication and the defection of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [raguse] {} on the 7th she learned in the morning of the recall of the [bourbons] {bourbon} until that moment as a cloud hid the future from sight the self seekers watching and waiting had not yet ventured to show their hands in her presence but at the news of the return of the [bourbons] {bourbon} everyone sought to make his peace with the new power the same thing that happened to [napoleon] {} happened to [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [louise] {louse} it was a race as to who could most openly and with the greatest speed desert her it was a race of ingratitude it was a steeplechase of treason she had left [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} a week before the daughter of an emperor the wife of an emperor the mother of a king [orléans] {} had saluted her as she passed through with the pealing of its bells and the firing of its artillery she had a court around her a treasure in her arms two peoples those of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} and [italy] {} some forty millions of souls were her subjects in a week she lost rank power inheritance kingdom in an hour she found herself left alone with a poor deserted child and treasure that was speedily taken away from her god forbid that i should pity the lot of this woman but those who betrayed her those who deserted her those who immediately robbed her could not plead the excuse of an unknown future still hid from them on the 7th as we have said the whole court fled on the morning of the 8th the two kings [jérôme] {} and [joseph] {} also left on the evening of the 8th general [schouwaloff] {} arrived with orders from the sovereigns to take her from [blois] {blobs, blocs, blogs, blots, blows} to [orléans] {} and from [orléans] {} to [rambouillet] {} finally on the morning of the 9th this announcement appeared in the [moniteur] {} the provisional government having been informed that by order of the sovereign whose dethronement was solemnly pronounced on 3 [april] {} considerable funds were taken away from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} during the days which preceded the occupation of that city by the allied troops it is decreed that these funds be seized wherever they may be found in whose [soever] {solver, sever} hands they may be found and that they be deposited immediately in the nearest bank this order was elastic it did not make any distinction between the public treasure of the nation and the emperor's private property moreover they confided the execution of this order to a man whose hatred for the fallen house would naturally incline him to the most violent measures they chose m [dudon] {} i am happily too young to be able to say who this m [dudon] {} was i have therefore asked the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [rovigo] {} whose accuracy is well known here is his reply to my questions m [dudon] {} was imprisoned at [vincennes] {} for having deserted his post for having left the army of [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} and full of cowardly fears himself for having communicated them to whomsoever he met nevertheless m [dudon] {} hesitated he looked about for an intermediary he did not dare to put his hand directly upon this wealth which was so much needed to pay for past treacheries and defections to come again what has m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [rovigo] {} to say let him be unto us the bronze mouthpiece of truth i write under his dictation an officer of the special police corps m [janin] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [chambéry] {} who is now a general officer was made use of he had been charged to escort the money this young man seeing the way to make his fortune gave himself up to m [dudon] {} he collected his regiment carried off with a very high hand the coffers which contained the emperor [napoleon's] {} treasure (for they had not yet been [unloaded)] {unloaded} and set off for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} which he reached without striking a blow but even all this did not satisfy them they had robbed the empress they would now kill the emperor only the dead do not return said the man who was [felicitously] {} styled the [anacreon] {} of the guillotine so many sayings have been attributed to m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [talleyrand] {} that we may well borrow one from [barère] {} for a change moreover it must be acknowledged that the question what to do with [napoleon] {} on 31 march was a very awkward one we must not be too angry with the people who wished to rid themselves of him who were these people [maubreuil] {} himself shall name them a conference was being held in the house in the rue saint [florentin] {} yes said the president to someone who had not yet opened his lips yes you are right we must rid ourselves of this man we must cried the other members in concert well then that is decided we will get rid of him only one other thing is lacking said one of the members of the [conventicle] {} what is that the principal thing the man who will deal the blow i know the man said a voice a trustworthy man a ruined man an ambitious man one who has fallen from a high position and would do anything for money and a position what is his name [maubreuil] {} this took place on the evening of 31 march that same day [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [armand] {armband} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [guerry] {} count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} marquis [d'orvault] {} had fastened the cross of the legion of [honour] {honor} which he had won bravely in [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} to his horse's tail and showed himself thus in the boulevards and on the place [louis] {louts} [xv] {v, x} he even did better than this in the place [vendôme] {} he tied a rope round the neck of the emperor's statue and with a dozen other worthy men of his kidney pulled with might and main then seeing that his forces were not strong enough he attached the rope to his horse even that was not enough they then asked for a relay of horses from the grand duke [constantin] {} who refused saying it is no business of mine now who went to seek this relay who made himself [maubreuil's] {} emissary a very great lord upon my word a most excellent name renowned in history true this most [puissant] {} [seigneur] {} the bearer of this [honourable] {honorable} name had to forget a slight obstacle namely that he owed everything to the emperor you ask his name ah indeed search for it as i have done [maubreuil] {} had indeed fallen from a high rank as his patron [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} had said there i see i have named his patron though i did not mean to name anyone never mind let us continue [maubreuil] {} who was of an excellent family had fallen indeed his father who had married for his second wife a sister of m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [roche] {} [jaquelein] {} was killed in the [vendéean] {} wars together with thirty other members of his family m [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} then secretary to the provisional government answered for [maubreuil] {} he did more he said to m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [talleyrand] {} come come here i am tearing off another mask without thinking what i am doing upon my word so much the worse since that pale face is unmasked let it remain he did much more he said to m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [talleyrand] {} i will bring him to you but m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [talleyrand] {} who was always cautious exclaimed what are you thinking of my dear sir bring m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} to me why so he must be conducted to [anglès] {angles} he must go to [anglès] {angles} you know quite well it is [anglès] {angles} who is attending to all this very well be it so i will take him there replied the secretary to the provisional government when this very evening my dear fellow you are beyond price take back that word [monseigneur] {} and [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} bowed went out and ran to [maubreuil's] {} house [maubreuil] {} was not at home when [maubreuil] {} was not at home everyone knew where he was he was gaming what game was it there are so many gambling [hells] {bells, cells, dells, fells, jells} in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} ran about all night without finding him returned to [maubreuil's] {} house and as [maubreuil] {} had still not returned he left word with his servant that he would expect [maubreuil] {} at his house the next day 1 [april] {} he waited for him the whole day evening came and still no [maubreuil] {} it is distracting to a man of [honour] {honor} to fail in his word what would m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [talleyrand] {} think of a man who had promised so much and performed so little twice during the day he wrote to [maubreuil] {} his second note was as pressing as time was this is what he said why have you not come i have expected you all day you are driving me to desperation [maubreuil] {} returned to change his dress at six o'clock that evening he found the note he ran off to [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} what is it you can make your fortune i am your man then come with me they entered a carriage and went to m [anglès'] {} m [anglès] {angles} was at the house in the rue saint [florentin] {} they rushed to the house in the rue saint [florentin] {} m [anglès] {angles} had just gone out they asked to see the prince impossible the prince is very busy he is in the act of betraying true he is betraying in good company he is betraying along with the senate the senate was next day going to declare that the emperor had forfeited his throne be it remembered that it was this same senate [sénat] {} [conservateur] {} which on the return from the disastrous [russian] {} campaign fifteen months earlier had said to the emperor sire the senate is established for the purpose of preserving the fourth dynasty [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} and posterity will find it faithful to this sacred duty and every one of its members will be ever ready to perish in [defence] {defense} of this palladium of the national prosperity we must admit that it was drawn up in very bad french it is also true that it was drawn up by very poor specimens of [frenchmen] {} the next day [maubreuil] {} and [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} returned the prince was no more visible than on the previous evening the prince was at the [luxembourg] {} but it did not matter they could be introduced into his cabinet presently which was occupied at the moment besides perhaps he might return we will wait said [roux] {roue, rout} [laborie] {} and they waited a short while in the green salon that green salon which became so famous you will remember in history they waited reading the papers

{} there are some very ill fated signatures on 22 [july] {duly, jury} 1808 this signature was at the foot of the capitulation treaty of [baylen] {} on 16 [april] {} 1814 it was at the foot of

princess that is exactly what we are looking for they withdrew and made a [pretence] {presence, pretense} of deliberating then after this cogitation they came up and gave orders to the commander of

at the same time on the 20th the day after the emperor bade farewell to his guards it was not in the midst of that pack of brigands that he could be attacked on the 21 [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} as we

deposited without verification at m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [vanteaux's] {} it could not be established who had abstracted the eighty four thousand francs in gold he referred to the [marvellous] {marvelous, marvelous} manner in which some of the jewels that had been thrown by an unknown hand into the [seine] {shine, spine, swine, seize, sine} had been recovered by a man named [huet] {duet, suet, hunt, hurt, hued} an ex [employé] {employs, employ} of the police who when fishing had drawn up two diamond combs caught in his hooked line me [couture] {} went on to assert that the prisoner to whom a mission of the gravest importance had been entrusted ought not to be tried by an ordinary court and to prove his point me [couture] {} read the five different orders which had [authorised] {authorized} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} to call into requisition all the officials of the kingdom the tenor of these orders was as follows the first signed by general [dupont] {} war minister [authorised] {authorized} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} to make use of the army which was to obey all his demands and commanded the authorities to furnish him with all the troops he might require as he was charged with a mission of the highest importance the second signed by [anglès] {angles} minister of police ordered all the police force throughout the kingdom of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} to lend assistance to m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} to the same end the third signed by [bourrienne] {} director general of the posts ordered all post masters to supply him with whatever horses he should require and to consider themselves personally responsible for the least delay they might occasion him the fourth signed by general [sacken] {sicken, sacked, slacken} governor of [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} enjoined the allied troops to assist m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} finally the fifth which was in [russian] {} was addressed to those officers who did not understand french and who could not therefore have obeyed the preceding orders from these documents me [couture] {} argued that the king's council alone must have had [cognisance] {cognizance} of m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil's] {} mission and alone ought to decide the case after having replied to me [couture's] {} pleading the king's procurator set forth his reasons for regarding the tribunal [correctionnel] {} as incompetent in the present case since the charges brought against the [sieur] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} constituted a crime and were not those of a simple [misdemeanour] {misdemeanor} that it was a question of a robbery under arms committed on the highway and not merely a case of breach of confidence for it was vain he said to try to allege the unlimited power with which the prisoner was vested no power could [authorise] {authorize} a citizen to run counter to existing laws for if such a contention could be maintained it could be pursued to its logical conclusion and in that case it might be excusable to commit a murder or burn down a village as a matter of fact continued m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [vatimesnil] {} we are advised that [maubreuil] {} acting as a government agent was endowed on that very count with a far graver responsibility and the law ought to be set in force against him with the greater severity no mission could excuse a man for having ill treated a person [travelling] {traveling, traveling} on the highways with a passport and his crime assumed still graver proportions when that person happened to be an august princess sprung from an illustrious house allied to all the crowned heads of [europe] {} and [travelling] {traveling, traveling} under the protection of a passport from her illustrious cousin the emperor of [russia] {} a princess who was entitled to double respect both from her rank and because of the reverses of fortune she had recently experienced and exclaimed the king's counsel with what indignation ought we to be seized when we hear the accused uttering such [libellous] {libelous, libelous} fables to avoid the course of justice who are those [frenchmen] {} he addresses whom he invokes to his aid what faith could be put in such an unlikely story as that he had received a mission against a person [travelling] {traveling, traveling} under the safeguard of the most solemn treaties signed by all the allied sovereigns and if he did accept such a mission was it not doubly mean to have accepted money for carrying it out and then to have deceived those whom he pretended had given it him should he not be regarded henceforth as one of those hateful creatures known of all men who under pressure of an accusation hatches conspiracies and denounces unknown fellow citizens to the sole end of arresting or diverting justice the [sieur] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [maubreuil] {} had listened to all this tirade with fiery impatience and his solicitor had only been able to pacify him by allowing him the pen and paper which he demanded when m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [vatimesnil's] {} speech was over [maubreuil] {} passed what he had just written to the president then rose and said m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [président] {president} as a man who expects to be assassinated at any moment i place this political deposition in your hands [frenchmen] {} it is my [honour] {honor} i am bequeathing to all you who are here present as a man on the brink of appearing before god i swear that it was m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [talleyrand] {} who by means of m [laborie] {} sent me that the prince forced me to sit down in his own arm chair that he offered me two hundred thousand [livres] {lives}

was to save the emperor and his family here they again compelled [maubreuil] {} to stop speaking and the warders taking hold of him by his shoulders forced him down into his seat then his lawyer me [couture] {} rose addressed the king's counsel once more and begged for pity's sake that no notice should be taken of his client's mad words alas he cried the man whom you see before you monsieur is

instead of there being as usual plenty of room for everyone just to hear four lines thought to contain an allusion to the political encroachments in which the king's [favourite] {favorite} minister

[même] {meme, mime} all the same these four lines roused thunders of applause and rounds of cheering and then one heard on every side the concert of admiration which all the liberal papers sounded in praise of the patriotic young poet the whole party petted him praised him exalted him some time after the [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} had been played at the [odéon] {} the [théâtre] {} [français] {} on 5 [november] {} 1819 put [louis] {louts} [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if} on the stage this was the royalist reply which the leading [theatre] {} gave to the nationalist tragedy at the [odéon] {} at that period [ancelot] {} and [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} were about equally celebrated and in the eyes of impartial critics [louis] {louts} [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if} was as good as [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} but all the popularity all the applause all the triumph went to the liberal poet it was as though the nation were breathing again after its suspension of animation from '93 onward as though it were urging the public spirit to take the path of liberty i recollect that because of the noise these two controversial plays made throughout the whole of the literary world i who was just beginning to feel the first breath of poetry stir within me was anxious to read them i wrote to [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} who sent me both the liberal and the royalist work the liberal work was the most praised and with that in my hand i ran to announce to our young friends [adèle] {addle} [albine] {alpine, albino} and [louise] {louse} the good fortune which had befallen us from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} it was decided that the same evening we should read the masterpiece aloud and as i was the owner of the work i was naturally promoted to the office of reader alas we were but simple children without knowledge of either side of the case artless young folk who wanted to amuse ourselves by clapping our hands and to be stirred to the heart by admiration we were greatly surprised at the end of the first act more surprised still by the end of the second that so much fuss and noise should have been aroused by and so much praise bestowed upon a work estimable no doubt in its way but one which did not cause a single thrill of sentiment or passion or rouse an echoing memory we did not yet understand that a political passion is the most prejudiced of all passions and that it vibrates to the innermost feeling of a disturbed country our reading was interrupted at the second act and the tragedy of [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} was never finished at any rate as a joint reading our audience had [naïvely] {naively} confessed that [montfort] {} [lorédan] {} and [procida] {} bored them to death and that they much preferred tom thumb puss in boots and other fairy tales of like nature but this attempt did not satisfy me when i went home to my mother i read not only the whole of [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} but also [louis] {louts} [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if} well it is with feelings of great satisfaction that i date from that time the impartial appreciation for contemporary works which i possess an appreciation borrowed far more from my feelings than from my judgment an appreciation which neither political opinion nor literary hatred has ever been able to influence my critical faculty when considering the work of my [confrères] {confreres} asks not whether it be the work of a friend or of an enemy whether of one intimately known to me or of a stranger however i need hardly say that neither [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} nor [louis] {louts} [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if} belong to that order of literature which i was to be called upon later to feel and to understand whose beauties i [endeavoured] {endeavored} to reproduce i remained perfectly unmoved by these two tragedies although i slightly preferred [louis] {louts} [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if} i have never read them again since and probably i shall never re read them but i feel convinced that if i were to re read them my opinion upon them would be just the same to day [that'] {that, that's} it was then what a difference there was between the tame and monotonous feeling i then experienced and the glowing emotion hamlet roused in me though it was the curtailed bloodless nerveless hamlet of [ducis] {ducks, ducts} i had an innate instinct for truth and hatred of conventional standards [terence's] {} line has always seemed to me one of the finest lines ever written i am a man and nothing that is human is alien unto me and i was fast laying claim to my share in that line i was growing more manly every day my mother was the only person who continued to look upon me as though i were still a child she was therefore greatly astonished when one evening i did not return at my usual time of coming home and when at last i did come in towards three in the morning my heart leaping joyfully i slipped into my room which for the last three months i had obtained leave to have to myself apart from my mother foreseeing what was going to take place i found my mother in tears seated by my window where she had been watching for my return ready to give me the lecture such a late or rather early return deserved after more than a year of attentions signs loving making little [favours] {favors} granted refused snatched by force the inexorable door which shut me out at eleven o'clock would be softly reopened at half past eleven and behind that door i found two trembling lips two caressing arms a heart beating against my heart burning sighs and lingering tears [adèle] {addle} too had managed to get a room to herself apart from her mother just as i had this room was better than an ordinary room it was a tiny summer house which projected into a long garden enclosed only by hedges a passage between the room occupied by her brother and the room occupied by her mother led to the garden and consequently to the summer house which was only separated from the passage by a staircase leading to the first [storey] {stormy, stored, stores, story, store} it was the door of this passage opening on one side into the street and on the other as i have said into the garden which was reopened to me at half past eleven at night and was not closed behind me until three in the morning on that night when my mother stood anxiously waiting all in tears at the window of my room just ready to go and seek for me in the six hundred houses of the town but what plagued my mother still more was as i quickly discovered that though she had not the least doubt as to the reason for my misconduct she could not guess who was the young lady at the bottom of it she had not seen me come back the way she had expected the reason for that was simple enough the little girl who had given her heart to me after more than a year's struggle was so pure so innocent so modest that although my love and pride were ready to reveal everything my conscience told me that [honour] {honor} and every fine feeling i had demanded that the secret be kept with the utmost care therefore so that no one should see me at such an hour either in the [neighbourhood] {neighborhood} of her house or in the street leading to it when at three in the morning i came out of the [blest] {blast, bleat, bless, lest, best} passage that had served me in good stead i made my exit by a little by street and gained the fields from the fields i entered the park leaping a ditch like the one over which i had given proofs of my agility to mademoiselle [laurence] {} under such different circumstances at [whitsuntide] {} finally from the park i reached what was called with us the [manège] {manage, manege, mange} and i re entered the town by the rue [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [château] {chateau} it so happened therefore that my mother who was watching in an entirely opposite direction did not see me return and not guessing the ruse i had made use of to foil the cruel and ready slander little towns are so prone to set going should matters so turn out she puzzled her wits in despair to know where i had come from my mother's ignorance and the suspicions that grew up in her mind later in connection with another girl had a sufficiently serious influence upon my future life for me to dwell on the subject for a moment these details are not so trivial as they may appear at first sight is it not the case that some minds regard everything as trivial whilst others (and i am much inclined to think that these latter without wishing to speak evil of the former class of people are the true thinkers and the true [philosophers)] {philosophers} who try to follow the thread providence holds in his hands with which he guides men from birth to death from the unknown to the unknown look upon every detail as of importance because the slightest has its part in the great mass of details which we call life well i was well scolded by my mother who did not scold me long i however for i kissed her the whole time she scolded me besides her uneasiness was somewhat allayed and with the eye of a mother and perhaps even more with the insight of a woman which sees to the very heart of things she saw i was profoundly happy joy is as much a mystery as sorrow excessive joy approaches so nearly the border of pain that like suffering it too has its measure of tears my mother left me to go to bed not because she was tired out poor mother but because she felt i wanted to be alone with myself with my recent memories which i clasped as closely to my throbbing heart as one holds to one's breast a young nestling which is trying to fly away oh but [maître] {} [mennesson's] {} office was deserted that day how beautiful the park looked to me the tall trees with their whispering leaves the birds singing above my head and the frightened roebuck on the skyline all seemed to make a frame which could scarce contain my smiling thoughts my thoughts which danced like a joyous nymph love first love the welling up of the sap opens out life to us it flows through the most secret recesses of our being it gives life to the most remote of our senses it is a vast realm

the terrible refrain which the sinister horseman repeats over and over again to the trembling betrothed whom he carries off on his [spectre] {spectra} steed [hourra] {} [fantôme] {} [les] {hes, mes, yes, lbs, lea} [morts] {forts, ports, sorts, torts, marts} [vont] {cont, font, wont, vent, volt} [vite] {bite, cite, kite, lite, mite} bears so little resemblance to the conceits of [demoustier] {} to [parny's] {parry's, party's} amorous rhymes or to the elegies of the [chevalier] {} [bertin] {} that the reading of the tragic [german] {merman, germane} ballad made a complete revolution in my soul that very night i tried to put it into verse but as may well be understood the task was beyond my powers i broke the wings of my poor [fledgeling] {fledgling} muse and i began my literary career as i had begun my first love making by a defeat none the less terrible because it was a secret one but quite as incontestable in my own estimation what mattered it these were indubitably my first steps towards the future god had destined untried [totterings] {tottering} like the steps of a child just learning to walk who stumbles and falls as soon as he tears himself away from his nurse's leading strings but who picks himself up again and aching after every fall continues to advance urged forward by hope which whispers in his ear walk child walk it is by means of suffering that you become a man by perseverance that you become great chapter [iii] {} the [cerberus] {} of the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [largny] {} i tame it the ambush madame [lebègue] {} a confession six months passed by between my first love makings and my first attempts at work besides our meetings at [louise] {louse} [brézette's] {} every night [adèle] {addle} and i used to see each other two or three times a week in the summer house which to our great delight her mother had allowed her to have as her new chamber it was necessary for [adèle] {addle} to open the door of the passage way for me and for me to pass in front of her mother's bedroom door these two courses were fraught with so many dangers that i had for a long time been contemplating some other means of access to my lady love after much pondering i settled upon a way i carefully examined the topography of the surrounding district and discovered three doors off [adèle's] {} house a door which led through a kind of passage into a small garden one wall and two hedges separated this garden from [adèle's] {} i carefully studied the position all round from [adèle's] {} garden to which i had free entree during the daytime and i saw that all difficulties would be overcome if i could open the street door cross the passage enter the garden scale the wall and stride over the two hedges then i had only to knock on the outside shutter [adèle] {addle} would open to me and the thing would be done but as i had noticed the door had to be opened and the passage crossed the door was locked and the passage was guarded at night by a dog who was less a match from his size and from the fight he might make than from the noise he could set up it took me a week to make my investigations one night i ascertained [muphti] {} (that was the dog's [name)] {named, names, name} barking loudly all the time that the lock only turned once and that i could open the door with my knife blade the remaining seven nights i cultivated [muphti's] {} acquaintance seducing him little by little by poking bits of bread and chicken bones under the door the last two or three nights [muphti] {} grown used to the windfalls i brought him impatient for my arrival expecting me long before i appeared heard me come when i was twenty paces off and at my approach scratched with both paws at the door and whined gently at the obstacle that separated us on the eighth day or rather the eighth night feeling sure that [muphti] {} was now no longer an enemy but an ally i opened the door and according to my expectations [muphti] {} [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} upon me in the greatest friendliness delighted to find himself in direct communication with a man who brought him such dainty scraps i had only one fault to find with his greeting namely that it was expressed in rather too noisy a fashion however as all enthusiasm calms down in time [muphti's] {} enthusiasm died down and passing into expressions of a gentler affection allowed me to venture farther i chose for my first attempt at housebreaking a dark [moonless] {} autumn night i stepped very lightly with my ears on the alert i advanced without making a single grain of sand crunch beneath my feet i thought i heard a door open behind me i hastened my steps i reached a large patch of beans growing up on sticks into which i flung myself as did [gulliver] {} in his wheat field with [muphti] {} hidden between my legs his neck held between both my hands ready to be able to intercept the slightest sound he might wish to make and there i waited it was indeed one of the inhabitants to whom the passage belonged he had heard the noise in order to find out what caused it he took a turn in the garden passed within a couple of steps of me without seeing me coughed as though he were beginning with a cold and went indoors again i let [muphti] {} go i made for the palings i [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} to the other side of the wall i straddled over the two hedges and i ran to the shutters but i did not need to knock before i reached them i heard someone breathing i saw a shadow i felt two trembling arms stretch out to enfold me and drag me inside the summer house and the door shut behind us oh had i only been a poet in those days what ravishing lines i could have made in [honour] {honor} of those first flowers which flourished in the garden of our love but alas i was not a poet then and i had to be satisfied with repeating to [adèle] {addle} [parny's] {parry's, party's} and [bertin's] {} elegies which i believe only bored her i have already remarked apropos of [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} what good taste this little girl possessed i left her as usual towards two or three in the morning as usual also i returned by the park and reached home by a roundabout way i have explained the way i took and how i had to leap a wide ditch so as to reach the park from the open country in order to avoid making the same jump three or four times a week which was a very perilous feat on dark nights i made a very big heap of stones in one corner of the ditch so that i had only to make for this particular corner and then make my jump in two leaps on this particular night as i [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} into the ditch i noticed a shadow four paces off me that looked slightly less caressing than that which had awaited me in the garden and drawn me inside the summer house this shadow held an actual stout stick not the shade of one in all its knotty reality directly i attained to manhood's estate and whenever danger faced me whether by night or by day i may proudly record that i always marched straight on towards that danger i walked right up to the man with the stick the stick rose and i clutched it in my hand then followed in that dark ditch one of the severest tussles i have ever had in my life i was indeed the person he was lying in wait for the person he wished to meet the man who was waiting for me had blackened his face consequently i could not [recognise] {recognize} him but without [recognising] {recognizing} him i guessed who he was he was a young man of twenty four or twenty five i was scarcely eighteen but i was well broken in to all physical exercises especially to wrestling i succeeded in taking hold of him round the body and twisting him under me his head struck on a stone with a heavy sound no word passed on either side but he must have been hurt i felt him fumbling in his pocket and i knew he was hunting for his knife i seized his hand above the wrist and managed to twist him so that his fingers opened and the knife dropped then by a quick move i got hold of the knife for one second a terrible temptation assailed me to do what was indeed my right namely to open the knife and to plunge it into my antagonist's breast that moment a man's life hung by a thread had my anger broken that thread the man would have been killed i had sufficient control over myself to get up i still held the knife in one hand i took the stick by the other and fortified by these two weapons i allowed my adversary to rise too he took a step backwards and stooped to pick up the stone against which he had hurt his head but just as he was lifting himself up i hit him with the end of the stick on the chest and he fell back ten paces this time he seemed to lose consciousness completely for he did not get up again i climbed the embankment from the ditch and got away from the place as fast as i could this unexpected attack had revealed such a spirit of hatred that i feared treachery might follow no one else put in an appearance and i reached home very much upset i must confess by this incident i had certainly escaped from one of the most serious dangers i had ever incurred in my life this event brought very serious consequences to a person who had had nothing to do with the affair and led me to commit the only evil action i have to reproach myself with during the course of my life the blame attaching to this evil deed is all the greater as it was committed against a woman i can only say that it was committed without any premeditation i reached home as i have said very glad to have escaped with nothing worse than a few bruises and very proud at the end of the fray to have overthrown my enemy next morning i went to [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} as such an attack might be renewed under more disadvantageous circumstances than those from which i had just escaped i wanted to borrow from him the pocket pistols i had seen in his rooms it was difficult to borrow them from him without telling him why i wanted them i told him but as it would have revealed or almost revealed the house i came away from if i had told him the true locality of the struggle i indicated another place altogether i selected [hap] {cap, gap, lap, map, nap} hazard a spot near the [manège] {manage, manege, mange} in a little narrow street where three houses had their entrances the first of these three houses was inhabited by [hippolyte] {} [leroy] {} the ex body guardsman of whom i have already spoken in connection with our misadventures at m [collard's] {collar's} and who was soon to become my cousin by marrying [augustine] {} the second by the [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} family and the third by the lawyer to whom [maître] {} [mennesson] {} had related the misadventures of my early love making and who as i have already mentioned had married Éléonore the second daughter of m [deviolaine] {} by his first marriage i have related also when speaking of m [lebègue] {} how the charming nature and sociable spirit of his wife had roused suspicion and dislike in a little town where superiority of any kind is a reason for jealousy now i had told others besides [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} of the nocturnal attack of which i had very nearly been a victim and to others also as well as to [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} in order to divert suspicions i had mentioned the same locality by the [manège] {manage, manege, mange} of which i have just spoken where could i have been coming from at two in the morning when i was attacked near the manage it could not have been from [hippolyte] {} [leroy's] {} it could not have been from [adolphe] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven's] {leaven's} it must then have been from m [lebègue's] {} or rather from madame [lebègue's] {} this wicked suggestion entirely incorrect as it was could only be supported by some semblance of a foundation i was a very easy prey to being teased perhaps because i laid myself open to it by my [defenceless] {defenseless} condition and neither madame [lebègue] {} nor her sisters spared me madame [lebègue] {} was pretty witty and a flirt she waved the most charming and gracious gestures imaginable to her friends at a distance whilst at closer quarters she allowed them to look at admire and even kiss her hand with that aristocratic indifference assumed by women who are the possessors of pretty hands it was her only sin poor woman the crime was great but the hand was pretty i was exceedingly fond of madame [lebègue] {} i liked her i can confess to day with a feeling that might even have got beyond the bounds of friendly affection if she had consented to more but she had never given me the least encouragement and whenever i was near her her superior wit her woman of the world manners her fine lady airs would send me into the deepest depths of that shyness of which i had given such glaring proofs during my earliest love makings one day without knowing whence this [rumour] {rumor} had sprung without suspecting the cause that had given rise to it i heard it whispered that i was madame [lebègue's] {} lover i ought at once to have quenched this [rumour] {rumor} with indignant denials i ought to have treated the calumny with the justice it deserved i was wicked enough to refute it half [heartedly] {heatedly} and in such a fashion that my vain denial bore every appearance of a confession and of course the ill [natured] {matured, natures, nature} [rumour] {rumor} served my own purposes to perfection poor silly fool that i was i had a momentary delight an hour's pride in this [rumour] {rumor} which ought to have made me blush with shame for i had allowed an untrue statement to be believed i soon suffered for my mean action first of all the [rumour] {rumor} set me at variance with the person herself whom it concerned madame [lebègue] {} thought me more guilty than i was she accused me of having started the scandal she was mistaken there i had allowed it to live allowed it to grow that was all true that was bad enough she forbade me her house the house my mother and i both loved and it became hostile to us both ever after madame [lebègue] {} never forgave me on two or three occasions during my life i have felt the prick of the needle of the vengeance she vowed against me i never attempted to return the injuries received i felt in my heart of hearts i had deserved them whenever since i have met madame [lebègue] {} i have turned away my head and lowered my eyes before her glance the guilty one tacitly confessed his crime to day he openly avows it but now the confession has been made i can boldly face the rest of the world of men or women and say you may look me in the face and try to make me blush if you can the day after my struggle i had the curiosity to visit the scene of battle i had not been mistaken the stone on which my enemy's head had crashed was stained with blood at its sharpest end and the [colour] {color} of a few hairs stuck to the bloody stone confirmed my suspicions which now became a definite certainty when furnished with this last proof that night i saw [adèle] {addle} she was still ignorant of what had happened to me i told her everything i told her whom i suspected she refused to believe it just at that moment a surgeon named [raynal] {} went past i had seen him that morning come from the direction which led to the house of my wounded enemy i went up to him what is the matter i asked him why have you been sent for this morning what is the matter boy he replied in his [provençal] {} accent yes why he cannot have seen plainly last night and hurrying home he gave himself a knock in the chest against a carriage pole it was such a violent blow that he fell on his back and split his head open in falling when shall you pay him a second visit to morrow at the same time as to day very well doctor tell him from me that last night passing by the same place where he fell after him i found his knife and i send it back to him tell him doctor that it is a good weapon but that nevertheless a man who has no other arms but this with him is unwise to attack a man who possesses two such pistols as these i fancy the doctor understood oh yes very good he said [i'll] {ill, it'll} tell him never fear i presume that the man who owned the knife also understood for i never heard the matter spoken of again although fifteen days later i danced [vis]

of my failure to translate [bürger's] {burger's} beautiful ballad but as he had made up his mind to make me a dramatic author he consoled me by telling me it was his father's opinion that some [german] {merman, germane} works were absolutely [untranslatable] {} and that the ballad of [lénore] {} was first among these seeing that [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} did not lose hope i gradually regained mine i may even venture to say that a few days after this i achieved a success [lafarge] {} had laughed hugely at [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven's] {leaven's} idea of making me

to day feel a very lively interest reading instead all that is bad in [voltaire] {} who was then regarded as the very antithesis of politics and religion having never opened a volume of [walter] {falter, halter, salter, welter, waiter} [scott] {scoot, scout} or of cooper those two great romance writers one of whom understood men thoroughly the other of whom divined god's workings [marvellously] {marvelously, marvelously} whilst on the contrary he had devoured all the naughty books of [pigault] {} [lebrun] {} raving over them [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [citateur] {} in

[dunghill] {} [ducis] {ducks, ducts} had collected those pearls called [othello] {} hamlet and [romeo] {rodeo} and [juliet] {} but knowing by heart his [bertin] {} his [parny] {parry, party} his [legouvé] {} his [demoustier] {} [lafarge] {} was unquestionably in the right and [adolphe] {} must have had plenty of time to waste to undertake such a task the hopelessness of which alone could take away from its ridiculousness but [adolphe] {} with that [anglo] {angle} [german] {merman, germane} [stolidness] {solidness} of his manfully persevered in the work undertaken and we sketched out a scheme of a comedy in one act entitled the major [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [strasbourg] {} it was neither good nor bad why the major of [strasbourg] {} any more than the major of [rochelle] {} or of [perpignan] {} i am sure i cannot tell and i have also completely forgotten the plot or development of that embryonic dramatic work but there was one incident i have not forgotten for it procured me the first gratification my amour [propre] {} received it was the epoch of patriotic pieces a great internal reaction had set in against our reverses of 1814 and our defeat of 1815 the national couplet and chauvinism were all the rage provided you made [français] {} rhyme with [succès] {} at the end of a couplet and [lauriers] {} with [guerriers] {} you were sure of applause so of course [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} and i were quite content not to strike out any fresh line but to follow and worship in the footsteps of mm [francis] {francs} and [dumersan] {} therefore our major [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [strasbourg] {} was of the family of those worthy retreating officers whose patriotism continued to fight the enemy in couplets consecrated to the supreme glory of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} and to the avenging of [leipzig] {} and [waterloo] {} on the battlefields of the [gymnase] {gymnast} and the varies now our major having become a common [labourer] {laborer} was discovered by a father and son who arrived on the scene i know not why at the moment when instead of digging his furrows he was deserting his [plough] {slough} in order to devote himself to the reading of a book which gradually absorbed him to such an extent that he did not see the entrance of this father and son a most fortunate circumstance since the brave officer's

m [decazes] {decades} monsieur he said as soon as he saw him you must go to the church of [ste] {ate, rte, see, she, sue} [geneviève] {} you must descend to the crypt where you will find the tomb of cardinal [caprara] {} and you must bring away the thing no matter what it is that you will find on the tomb m [decazes] {decades} went and when he reached [ste] {ate, rte, see, she, sue} [geneviève] {} he went down to the crypt there to his great surprise he found nothing on the tomb of cardinal [caprara] {} but a fragment of oriental alabaster however his orders were precise we might rather say they were positive after a moment's hesitation he picked up the bit of alabaster and took it back to the [tuileries] {} he expected the king to jeer at the servile obedience that brought him only an object so worthless but quite the reverse was the case for at the sight of the bit of alabaster the king trembled then taking it in his hand and examining it minutely he placed it on his desk now said [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} send a trusted messenger to the royal library he must ask for the works of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [augustine] {} the 1669 edition and in volume 7 between pages 404 and 405 he will find a sheet of paper but sire asked m [decazes] {decades} why should not i myself go rather than entrust this commission to another out of the question [mon] {con, don, eon, ion, non} [enfant] {infant} [mon] {con, don, eon, ion, non} [enfant] {infant} was the pet name by which the king called his [favourite] {favorite} minister a trusted messenger was sent to the royal library he opened [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [augustine] {} at the given pages and found the paper described it was a simple matter to take it away the paper was a very thin blank folio sheet oddly snipped here and there while [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} was searching for the mysterious revelations hidden in the jagged paper the secretary brought him a missive containing a leaf of the same size as that from the [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [augustine] {} but inscribed with apparently unintelligible letters at the corner of the envelope in which this leaf came were written the two words most urgent the king understood that there was a connection between the two events and a likeness between the two leaves he placed the cut sheet of paper over the written sheet and saw that the letters shown up through the holes in the upper leaf made sense he dismissed the secretary and intimated to m [decazes] {decades} to leave him alone and when both had gone he made out the following lines king thou art betrayed betrayed by thy minister and by the p p of thy s king i alone can save thee [mariani] {} the reader will understand that i do not hold myself responsible for this note any more than for the rest of the anecdote the king did not mention this note to anyone but that evening the minister of the police [1] who was dismissed next day issued orders to find a man named [mariani] {} the following day which was [sunday] {sundry, sundae} the 13th of [february] {} the king on opening his prayer book at mass found this note inside they have found out what i wrote they are hunting for me do your utmost to see me if you would avoid great misfortunes for your house i shall know if you will receive me by means of three wafers which you should stick inside the panes of your bedroom windows although the king was greatly interested by this last letter of advice he did not think it sufficiently urgent to attend to it as directed he waited and hesitated and then left matters till the morrow that evening there was a special performance at the opera when [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [rossignol] {} [les] {hes, mes, yes, lbs, lea} [noces] {nodes, noses, notes, noes} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [gamache] {} and [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [carnaval] {carnival} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [venise] {} were played the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} and [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} berry were present about eleven o'clock at the close of the second act of the ballet the duchess feeling tired told her husband that she wished to leave the prince would not allow her to go alone but himself conducted her out of the opera house when he reached their carriage which stood in the rue [rameau] {} just as he was helping the princess up the step and saying to her wait for me i will rejoin you in a moment a man darted forward rapidly passed like a flash of lightning between the sentinel on guard at the door of exit and m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [clermont] {} [lodève] {} the gentleman in waiting seized the prince by the left shoulder [leant] {meant, least, leans, lent, lean} heavily against his breast and plunged a thin sharp small sword with a boxwood hilt in his right breast the man left the weapon in the wound knocked three or four curious bystanders spinning and disappeared immediately round the corner of the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [richelieu] {} and under the [colbert] {} arcade for the moment nobody noticed that the prince was wounded he himself had hardly felt any pain beyond the blow of a fist take care where you are going you clumsy fellow m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [choiseul] {} the prince's aide [de] {be, he, me, re, we} camp had exclaimed pushing the assassin to one side thinking he was simply an unduly inquisitive bystander suddenly the prince lost his breath grew pale and tottered crying out as he put his hand to his breast i have been assassinated impossible exclaimed those about him see replied the prince here is the dagger and giving effect to his words he drew out and held up the bloodstained sword from his breast the carriage door had not yet been shut the duchess sprang out trying to catch her husband in her arms but the prince was already past standing even with this support he fell gently back into the arms of those surrounding him and was carried into the drawing room belonging to the king's box there he received immediate attention by the mere appearance of the wound the shape of the dagger and the length of its blade the doctors [recognised] {recognized} the serious nature of the case and declared that the prince must not be taken to the [tuileries] {} they therefore carried him to the suite of rooms occupied by m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [grandsire] {} the secretary to the opera company who lived at the [theatre] {} by a singular coincidence the bed on which the dying prince was laid was the same on which he had slept the first night of his joyful re entry into [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [grandsire] {} was at that time at [cherbourg] {} and he had lent this very bed to put in the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} berry's room here the prince [learnt] {learns, learn} the arrest of his murderer he asked his name they told him it was [louis] {louts} [pierre] {pierce} [louvel] {louver} he seemed to search his memory and then as if speaking to himself he said i cannot recollect ever having injured this man no prince no you did nothing to him but you bear on your forehead the fatal seal which carries the [bourbons] {bourbon} to the grave or into exile no prince you have not injured the man but you are heir to the throne and that is sufficient in this country for the hand of god to be laid heavily upon you look back prince on what has happened to those who for the last sixty years have handled the fatal crown to which they aspired [louis] {louts} [xvi] {} died on the scaffold [napoleon] {} died at [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [helena] {} the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [reichstadt] {} died at [schoenbrünn] {} [charles] {charges} x died at [frohsdorf] {} [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} died at [claremont] {} and who knows prince where your son the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [chambord] {} will die where your cousin the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i ask the question of you who are about to know the secret of that eternal life which hides away from us all the mysteries of life and of death and we would further point out to you prince that not one of your race will die in the [tuileries] {} or will rest as kings in the tombs of their fathers but it was a good and noble heart that was about to cease to beat [amidst] {midst} all the distracting events of that period and when [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} who had been informed of the assassination came at six in the morning to receive his nephew's last wishes the first words of the wounded prince were sire pardon the man [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} neither promised nor refused to pardon my dear nephew you will survive this cruel act i trust he replied and we will then discuss the matter again it is of grave import moreover he added and it must be looked into most carefully at some future time these words had scarcely been uttered by the king when the prince began to fight for his breath he stretched out his arms and asked to be turned on his left side i am dying he said as they hastened to carry out his last wish and indeed they had hardly moved him when at the stroke of half past six he died the grief of the duchess was inexpressible she seized scissors from the mantelpiece let down her beautiful fair hair cut it off to the roots and threw the locks on the dead body of her husband the sorrow of king [louis] {louts} was twofold not knowing that the [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} berry was pregnant he deplored even more than the death of a murdered nephew the extinction of a race when he withdrew to the [tuileries] {} he remembered the events of the two preceding days the letter received on the very morning of the assassination the warning of some great calamity threatening the royal family then although there was nothing more to be expected from the mysterious stranger the legend that we have given goes on to say that [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} dragged his aching limbs to the window and stuck the three wafers on its panes as a signal of welcome to the unknown writer of the letters two hours later the king received a letter wrapped in three coverings it is too late let a confidential person come and meet me on the [pont] {cont, font, wont, pant, pent} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} arts where i will be at eleven o'clock to night i rely on the [honour] {honor} of the king at a quarter past eleven the mysterious stranger was introduced into the [tuileries] {} and conducted to the king's private chamber he remained with [louis] {louts} till one o'clock in the morning no one ever knew what passed in that interview the next day m [clausel] {clauses, clause} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [coussergues] {} proposed in the upper house to impeach m [decazes] {decades} as an accomplice in the assassination of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} berry thus at the same time that the [napoleonic] {} and liberal party were disseminating the skits against the [bourbons] {bourbon} which we have quoted and distributing copies of the proceedings of the [maubreuil] {} trial the extreme right was attacking by similar means the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} and m [decazes] {decades} each in turn undermining and destroying one another to the advantage of a fourth party which was soon to make its appearance under the cloak of [carbonarism] {} we mean that republican element which [napoleon] {} when he was dying in the island of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [helena] {} prophesied would dominate the future but before tackling this question one word more about [louvel] {louver} god forbid that we should glorify the assassin no matter to what party he belonged we would only indicate from the historical point of view the difference that may exist between one murderer and another we have related how [louvel] {louver} disappeared first round the corner of the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [richelieu] {} and then under the [colbert] {} arcade he was just on the point of escaping when a carriage barred his course and compelled him to slacken his pace during this moment of hesitation the sentinel who had thrown down his gun to pursue him and who had lost sight of him had a glimpse of him again and redoubled his speed caught up with him and seized him round the waist a waiter from a [neighbouring] {neighboring} [café] {cafe} at the same time seizing hold of him by his collar when he was captured the assassin did not attempt any fresh effort one would have thought that from motives of self preservation he would have struggled to escape but his one attempt at flight seemed to satisfy him and had they let go their hold he would not have taken his chance to regain liberty [louvel] {louver} was taken to the guard house below the vestibule of the opera wretch exclaimed m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [clermont] {} [lodève] {} what can have induced you to commit such a crime the desire to deliver [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} from one of its [cruellest] {cruelest, cruelest} enemies who paid you to carry out the deed paid me cried [louvel] {louver} tossing his head paid me then with a scornful smile he added do you think one would do such a thing for money [louvel's] {louver's} trial was carried to the upper chamber on 5 [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} he appeared before the high court on the following day he was condemned to death four months had been spent in trying to find his accomplices but not one had been discovered he was taken back to the [conciergerie] {} an hour after his sentence had been pronounced and one of his warders came to him you would like said the man to the prisoner who throughout his trial had preserved the utmost calm and even the greatest decorum you would like to send for a priest what for asked [louvel] {louver} why to ease your conscience oh my conscience is at ease it tells me i did my duty your conscience deceives you listen to what i say and make your peace with god that is my advice and if i confess do you suppose that will send me to paradise may be the mercy of god is infinite do you think the prince [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [condé] {condo} who has just died will be in paradise he should be he was an upright prince in that case i would like to join him there it would amuse me vastly to plague the old émigré the conversation was here interrupted by m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [sémonville] {} who came to try and extract information from the prisoner finding he could not get anything from him he said to [louvel] {louver} is there anything you want monsieur [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} replied the condemned man i have had to sleep between such coarse sheets in prison i would like some finer ones for my last night the request was granted [louvel] {louver} had his fine sheets and slept soundly between them from nine at night till six o'clock the next morning on 6 [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} at six in the evening he was taken from the [conciergerie] {} it was the time of the famous troubles of which we shall speak presently the streets were blocked and there were spectators even on the roofs he wore a round red cap and [grey] {prey, gray, grew} trousers and a blue coat was fastened round his shoulders the papers next day announced that his features were changed and his gait enfeebled nothing of the kind [louvel] {louver} belonged to the family of assassins to which [ravaillac] {} and [alibaud] {} were akin that is to say he was a man of stout courage he mounted the scaffold without bombast and also without any trace of weakness and he died as men do who have sacrificed their lives to an idea his cell was the last in the [conciergerie] {} to the right at the bottom of the corridor it was the same in which [alibaud] {} [fieschi] {} and [meunier] {} had been kept [1] m [decazes] {decades} [ministre] {ministry} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [l'intérieur] {} had charge of the police chapter [vi] {hi, mi, pi, ti, vs} [carbonarism] {} i will now (1821) give some details of the [carbonari] {} movement a subject on which [dermoncourt] {} and i had held long conversations [dermoncourt] {} was an old aide decamp of my father whose name i have often mentioned in the earlier chapters of these memoirs he was one of the principal leaders in the conspiracy of [béfort] {} you will recollect the troubles of [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} the death of young [lallemand] {} who was killed whilst trying to escape and was accused after his death of having disarmed a soldier of the royal guard it was thought that the dead could be accused with impunity but his father defended him the censorship sometimes a most infamous thing prevented the poor father's letter from appearing in the papers m [lafitte] {} had to take his letter to the chambers and to read it there before he could make its contents known to the public i give it in the form in which [lallemand] {} sent it to the newspapers when they refused to publish it sir yesterday my son was beaten to death by a soldier of the royal guard to day he is defamed by the [drapeau] {} [blanc] {bland, blank, blanch} the [quotidienne] {} and the journal [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [débats] {} i owe it to his memory to deny the fact cited by those papers the statement is false my son did not attempt to disarm one of the royal guard he was walking past unarmed when he received from behind the blow that killed him [lallemand] {} the military conspiracy of 19 august was the outcome of the troubles of [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} the chief members of the lodge [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [amis] {axis, amps, amid, amiss, amiss} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [verité] {verity} were involved in that conspiracy they afterwards separated two of the affiliated members mm [joubert] {} and [dugier] {} set out for [italy] {} they reached [naples] {maples, napes} in the midst of the revolution of 1821 a revolution during which patriots were shamefully betrayed by their leader [françois] {} the two named above threw themselves into the revolution and were affiliated to the [italian] {} [carbonari] {} while [dugier] {} returned to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} a member of a higher grade in the society this institution as yet unknown in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} had greatly appealed to [dugier] {} and he hoped to be able to establish it in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} he set forth the principles and aims of the society to the executive council of the lodge [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [amis] {axis, amps, amid, amiss, amiss} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [vérité] {} on whom they produced a profound impression [dugier] {} had brought back with him the rules of the [italian] {} society and he was [authorised] {authorized} to translate them this task he accomplished but the type of religious mysticism which formed the basis of these rules was not in the least congenial to french minds they adopted the institution minus the details which at that epoch would have made it unpopular and m [buchez] {} the same who on 15 may had tried to make [boissy] {bossy} [anglas] {angles} forgotten and mm [bazard] {hazard} and [flottard] {} were deputed to establish the french [carbonari] {} upon a basis better suited to french conditions of mind and thought on 1 may 1821 three young men then unknown none of them thirty years old met for the first time in the depths of one of the poorest quarters of the capital in a room which was very far removed from representing even to its owner the golden mean spoken of by [horace] {} they sat at a round table and with grave and even gloomy faces for they were not ignorant of the terrible work to which they were going to devote their lives they defined the first tenets of that society of [carbonari] {} which changed the [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} of 1821 and 1822 into one vast volcanic disturbance whose [flames'] {flames} burst out at the most opposite and unexpected quarters at effort la [rochelle] {} [nantes] {mantes, antes} and [grenoble] {} what was still more remarkable the work which these three revolutionary chemists were preparing had only one object in view namely to draw up a code for future conspirators leaving everyone perfectly free to agitate against anything he individually chose provided he conformed to the main rules of the association the following is a [résumé] {} of these rules since might is not right and the [bourbons] {bourbon} have been brought back by foreigners the [carbonari] {} band together to secure for the french nation free exercise of their rights namely the right to choose what form of government may be most suited to the country's needs it will be seen that nothing was clearly defined but in reality a republican form of government was being shadowed forth this however was not to be proclaimed until thirty seven years later and only then to be struck dead from its birth by the very hand to which it owed its being it need hardly be said that the hand was the hand of [napoleon] {} it is a family tradition of the [napoleons] {} to strangle liberty as soon as it has produced a first consul or a president even as in the case of those beautiful aloes which only flower once in fifty years and perish when they have brought forth their brilliant but ill fated blossoms which are but barren and deadly flowers the division of the [carbonari] {} into higher central and private lodges is well known none of these lodges was allowed to contain more than twenty members thus avoiding the penal law directed against societies which comprised over twenty members the higher lodge was composed of the seven founders of the [carbonari] {} these seven founders were [bazard] {hazard} [dugier] {} [flottard] {} [buchez] {} [carriol] {carrion} [joubert] {} and [limperani] {} each [carbonaro] {} was expected to keep a pistol and fifty cartridges in his house and he had to hold himself in readiness to obey orders sent him by his commanders from the higher lodge whether by day or night while the society of [carbonari] {} was being [organised] {organized} with its upper lodge of seven members above named something of the same kind of thing was being established in the chamber only less active vital and determined in character it was called the [comité] {comity} [directeur] {directer} and its title sufficiently indicates its purpose this [comité] {comity} [directeur] {directer} was composed of general la [fayette] {layette} his son [georges] {gorges} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [fayette] {layette} of [manuel] {mantel, manual} [dupont] {} (de [l'eure)] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [corcelles] {} senior [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} general [thiars] {} and of mm [mérilhou] {} and [chevalier] {} for military questions the committee added generals [corbineau] {} and [tarayre] {} the [comité] {comity} [directeur] {directer} and the higher lodge were in close communication with one another at first their meetings were only intended for general discussions for the young [carbonari] {} treated the old liberals with contempt and the latter reciprocated the feeling the [carbonari] {} charged the liberals with feebleness and vacillation the liberals in their turn accused the [carbonari] {} of impertinence and frivolity they might as well have accused one another of youth and age furthermore the [carbonari] {} had [organised] {organized} the whole plot of [béfort] {} without saying a single word to the [comité] {comity} [directeur] {directer} however [bazard] {hazard} was in league with la [fayette] {layette} and well aware of the general's burning desire after popularity now popular feeling in 1821 was on the side of the party in opposition the farther they advanced the more popular they became [bazard] {hazard} wrote to the general asking him to [authorise] {authorize} the use of his name as of one in [co] {do, go, ho, lo, mo} operation with them and the request was granted la [fayette] {layette} possessed this admirable characteristic he yielded at the first pressure without having taken the initiative personally and he went farther and more to the point than most people the secrets of the upper lodge were revealed to him and he was asked to join it he accepted the invitation was received into their number and became one of the most active conspirators of [béfort] {} in this he risked his head just as much as did the humblest of the confederates the boldest members of the chamber followed him and enlisted with him in the same cause these were [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} [dupont] {} (de [l'eure)] {} [manuel] {mantel, manual} [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} and [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [corcelles] {} senior they did not have long to wait for a recognition of their self sacrificing devotion when the revolution was set afoot they adopted the groundwork of the constitution of the year [iii] {} five directors were appointed and these five were la [fayette] {layette} [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [corcelles] {} senior [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} and [dupont] {} (de [l'eure)] {} [carbonarism] {} had its military side indeed it was more military than civil in character they relied strongly and with good reason upon the army in all their movements the army was abandoned by the king abused by the princes sacrificed to privileged parties and three parts given over to the opposition lodges were established in most regiments and everything was so well arranged that even the very movements of the regiments served as a means of propaganda in leaving the town where the president of the military lodge had been quartered for three months six months or a year as the case might be he received half a piece of money the other half being sent on in advance to the town where his regiment was going either to a member of the higher or central lodge the two halves of the coin were fitted together and the conspirators were thus put into communication by this means soldiers became commercial [travellers] {travelers, travelers} as it were charged with the spread of revolution throughout [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} thus we shall find that all insurrections which broke out were as much military as civil towards the middle of 1821 all plans were laid for a rising in [bordeaux] {} as well as at [béfort] {} at [neuf] {} [brisach] {} as well as at [rochelle] {} at [nantes] {mantes, antes} and [grenoble] {} at [colmar] {collar} and at [toulouse] {} [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} was covered with an immense network of affiliated societies so that the revolutionary influence had expanded unnoticed but active into the very heart of social life from east to west from north to south from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} that is from the higher lodge all orders were issued for the animation and support of the propaganda as the pulsations of the heart send the life giving blood to all parts of the human body everything was in readiness information had been received that thanks to the influence of four young men who had been previously compromised in the rebellion of 19 august the 29th infantry a regiment consisting of three battalions severally stationed at [béfort] {} [neuf] {} [brisach] {} and at [huningue] {} had been won over to the [carbonari] {} these four young men were a guardsman called [lacombe] {} lieutenant [desbordes] {} and second lieutenants [bruc] {} and [pegulu] {} to whom were joined a lawyer named [petit] {petite} [jean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} and a half pay officer called [roussillon] {} furthermore there was [dermoncourt] {} who had been placed on half pay and who lived in the market town of [widensollen] {} a mile away from [neuf] {} [brisach] {} he was engaged in the coming insurrection to lead the light cavalry which was stationed in barracks at [colmar] {collar} so much for the military operations the civil side of the conspiracy was also in motion and conducted by mm [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} and [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} who possessed factories near [mulhouse] {} and [béfort] {} and who exercised great influence over their [workpeople] {} almost all of whom were discontented with the government that had given back to the nobles their ancient privileges and to the priests their old influence these malcontents were eager to take part in any rising into which a leader might be ready to urge them so towards the close of 1821 the higher lodge in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} received the following news at [huningue] {} [neuf] {} [brisach] {} and at [béfort] {} the 29th infantry was stationed commanded by lieutenants carrel [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [gromely] {} and [levasseur] {} at [colmar] {collar} was the light cavalry headed by [dermoncourt] {} at [strasbourg] {} they had a stand by in the two regiments of artillery and in the battalion of [pontoniers] {} at [metz] {mete, met} in a regiment of engineers and better still the military school finally at spinal they had a regiment of [cuirassiers] {} mm [koechlin] {} and [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} could be relied upon not only for a rising at [mulhouse] {} but also all along the course of the [rhine] {shine, thine, whine, rhino} where private lodges were stationed making a total of more than 10 000 associates [amongst] {} the retired officers citizens customs officers and foresters all were men of determined character and ready to sacrifice their lives about this time my poor mother on reckoning up her income found we were so poor that she bethought her of our friend [dermoncourt] {} in hopes that he might perhaps have still some relations with the government so she decided to write and beg him to make inquiries with respect to that unpaid pension of 28 500 francs owing to my father for the years [vii] {via, vie, vim, viz} and [viii] {} of the republic the letter reached [dermoncourt] {} about 20 or 22 [december] {} eight days before the outbreak of insurrection he replied by return of post and on 28 [december] {} we received the following letter my good madame [dumas] {pumas, dumps} what the devil possesses you to imagine that i could have maintained relations with that rabble of scoundrels who manage our affairs at the present moment nay thank heaven i have retired i have nothing at all to do either by means of pen or sword with what is going on therefore my dear lady do not count on a poor devil like me for anything beyond my own miserable pittance of 1000 francs per [annum] {annul} but look to god who if he does watch what goes on here below should be very angry at the way things are done there are two alternatives either there is no good god or things would not go on as they are but i know you believe in the good god so put your trust in him one of these days things will be altered ask your son who must be a tall lad by now and he will tell you that there is a saying by a [latin] {satin, lain} author called [horace] {} to the effect that after rain comes fine weather keep your umbrella open then a little longer and if fine weather comes put it down and count on me be hopeful without hope which lingers at the bottom of every man's heart there would be nothing left to decent folk but to blow out their brains baron [dermoncourt] {} this letter said very little and yet it said a good deal my mother gathered that something lay behind it and that [dermoncourt] {} was in the secret on the day following the receipt of our letter this is what was happening at [béfort] {} carrying out the plan of the conspirators the signal was sent to [neuf] {} [brisach] {} and [béfort] {} at the same moment and at the identical hour and day or rather the same night these two places took up arms and raised the [tricolour] {tricolor} standard the insurrection took place on the night of 29 30 [december] {} a provisional government was proclaimed at [béfort] {} and then at [colmar] {collar} this government as we have already mentioned consisted of [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} general la [fayette] {layette} and [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} twenty five or thirty [carbonari] {} had received orders to set out to [béfort] {} they started without a moment's delay and arrived on the 28th in the daytime on the 28th just as [joubert] {} who had preceded them to [béfort] {} was preparing to leave the town in order to lead them in he met m [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} m [koechlin] {} was looking for him to tell him a singular piece of news m [voyer] {coyer, foyer, voter, voyeur} [d'argenson] {} who with himself and general la [fayette] {layette} formed the revolutionary triumvirate had indeed come but had shut himself up in his factories in the valleys behind [massevaux] {} stating that he did not wish to receive anyone there but that the instructions brought were to be kept for him all very well but what are we to do asked [joubert] {} listen said m [koechlin] {} i will go myself to [massevaux] {} i will look after [d'argenson] {} and draw him out [willy] {billy, dilly, filly, hilly, silly} [nilly] {billy, dilly, filly, hilly, silly} whilst you must try by what means you can to hurry up the arrival of la [fayette] {layette} whereupon the two conspirators left the one m [koechlin] {} post haste as he said to [massevaux] {} a little village off the main road perhaps seven miles from [béfort] {} and equidistant from [colmar] {collar} the other [joubert] {} posted off to lure a small town on the road to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} twenty leagues from [béfort] {} there a carriage stopped and he [recognised] {recognized}

and look for him at his castle of la grange the others returned with [joubert] {} to [béfort] {} to announce that the movement was delayed thus the 29th and 30th passed in useless waiting on the night between those two days general [dermoncourt] {} becoming impatient sent to [mulhouse] {} an under foreman called [rusconi] {} belonging to m [koechlin] {} this man had been once an officer in the [italian] {} army and had followed [napoleon] {} to [elba] {} he was sent to inquire whether anything had been [learnt] {learns, learn} by m [koechlin] {} [rusconi] {} set off at ten o'clock a m covered nine stiff leagues of country in driving rain and reached m [koechlin's] {} house at ten o'clock that night he found him entertaining ten of his friends and he took him aside to inquire whether he had news of the conspiracy m [d'argenson] {} would not budge there was no news yet from la [fayette] {layette} it was supposed he was being detained by [manuel] {mantel, manual} in the meantime general [dermoncourt] {} was to be patient and he should be informed when it was time to act but demanded the messenger for whom is he to act ah there lies the difficulty replied m [koechlin] {} the generals want [napoleon] {} [ii] {hi, mi, pi, ti, id} the others with [manuel] {mantel, manual} at their head want [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} general la [fayette] {layette} wants a republic but let us first overthrow the [bourbons] {bourbon} and then all will come clear [rusconi] {} left hired a carriage journeyed all that night reached [colmar] {collar} at ten o'clock next day and from [colmar] {collar} he went on foot to [widensollen] {} where he found the general ready for action nothing had been done during his absence this is what had happened [ary] {cry, dry, fry, pry, try} [scheffer] {} had found la [fayette] {layette} at la grange the general who belonged to the chamber and whose absence would have been remarked if he stayed away longer did not wish to reach [béfort] {} until the decisive moment he promised to set out that night on one condition that m [ary] {cry, dry, fry, pry, try} [scheffer] {} should make all speed to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to persuade [manuel] {mantel, manual} and [dupont] {} (de [l'eure)] {} the last two members of the provisional government to come and take part in the rebellion he must also bring back colonel

{mantel, manual} [dupont] {} and [fabvier] {} and got [manuel] {mantel, manual} and [dupont] {} to promise to set out that same night he took colonel [fabvier] {} in his carriage and again set out after la [fayette] {layette} followed by [manuel] {mantel, manual} and [dupont] {} whilst this string of carriages was bearing the revolution at full speed along the road from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} whilst m [jacques] {} [koechlin] {} preceded by [joubert] {} and carrel was nearing [béfort] {} and whilst colonel [pailhès] {} unaware of the arrival of [fabvier] {} was preparing to take command of the troops and [dermoncourt] {} with horse ready saddled awaited the signal second lieutenant [manoury] {} one of the chief associates was changing guard with one of his comrades and installing himself at the main gate of the town at the same time that the other initiated members were warning their friends that the moment had come and that in all probability the rising would take place during the night of 1 [january] {} 1822 now the evening of 1 [january] {} had come only a few hours more and all would burst forth in the meanwhile night approached at eight o'clock the roll was called after roll call the non commissioned adjutant [tellier] {teller} went the round of all the sergeant majors ordering them to their rooms where each company put flints to the muskets packed knapsacks and prepared to march the sergeant majors returned to supper with [manoury] {} twenty paces from the place where [manoury] {} and his sergeant majors supped colonel [pailhès] {} went to the [hôtel] {hotel} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [poste] {paste, posse, posts, pose, post} to dine with a score of the insurgents and as the host of a posting inn is generally one of the principal ringleaders no one was anxious and the dining room was decorated with [tricoloured] {} flags and cockades and eagles and indeed what had they to fear no officer occupied the barracks and at midnight the insurrection broke out alas none knew what an accumulation of [unlooked] {uncooked, unhooked, unlocked, unloosed} for misfortunes was to escape out of the [pandora's] {} box which men call fate a sergeant whose six [months'] {months} furlough had expired that evening and who in consequence of his long absence knew nothing of what was going forward reached [béfort] {} on the evening of 1 [january] {} just in time to answer to the roll call and to assist in the preparations when these preparations were accomplished he wished to show proof of his promptness and zeal to his captain by going to tell him the regiment was ready ready for what asked the captain to march to march where to the place which has been appointed the captain gazed at the sergeant what is it you say he asked again i say that the knapsacks are packed captain and the flints are in the muskets you are either drunk or mad cried the captain take yourself off to bed the sergeant was just about to withdraw in fact when another officer stopped him and questioned him more minutely gathering by the accuracy of his replies that it was really the truth how could such an order be given unless the two captains had known of it who gave the order doubtless it must have been the lieutenant colonel no doubt the sergeant replied mechanically both the captains rose and went to find the lieutenant colonel he was equally astonished and as much in the dark as they were the order must have come from m [toustain] {} deputy governor and commander at arms of the fortress of [béfort] {} they all three went to m [toustain] {} he had not heard anything of the [rumour] {rumor} they brought him but suddenly an idea struck him it was a plot the two captains at once rushed back to the barracks to order the knapsacks to be [unstrapped] {} the flints to be taken out of the muskets and the soldiers to be confined to the barracks in the meantime the deputy governor visited the posts the two officers rushed to the barracks and m [toustain] {} began his inspection one of the first posts he came to was that guarded by [manoury] {} as he came nearer he saw by the light of his lantern a group of four people this group struck him as looking suspicious and he accosted them they were four young men dressed like citizens the king's lieutenant interrogated them who are you gentlemen he asked we are citizens of this [neighbourhood] {neighborhood} commandant what are your names whether from carelessness or from surprise or whether they did not want to lie these four youths gave their names [desbordes] {} [bruc] {} [pegulu] {} and [lacombe] {} the reader will recollect that they had all four been in the insurrection of 19 august and their names had been blazoned in the papers so they were perfectly familiar to the deputy governor he called to the head of the guard [manoury] {} and ordered him to arrest the four young men to put them under a guard and then to give him five men to go out and clear the entrance to the suburbs scarcely had the deputy governor gone a hundred steps when he perceived what looked to be twenty five or thirty persons taking flight some of them were in uniform [amongst] {} them he [recognised] {recognized} an officer of the 29th m [toustain] {} sprang on him and stretched out his hand to seize him by the collar but the officer freed himself and presenting a pistol at close quarters fired full at m [toustain's] {} chest the bullet hitting the cross of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [louis] {louts} which it broke and flattened the shock was quite enough however to knock down the commandant but he soon got to his feet and as he saw that his five men were no match against thirty he returned to the town and stopped at the guard house to take up [bruc] {} [lacombe] {} [desbordes] {} and [pegulu] {} all four had disappeared [manoury] {} one of the officers had set them free and had disappeared with them the deputy governor marched straight to the barracks and put himself at the head of the battalion this he led to the market place sending his company of grenadiers to guard the gate of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} and to arrest whoever should attempt to go out but he was already too late for all the insurgents were outside the town after leaving his two chiefs the non commissioned officer who had let out everything met adjutant [tellier] {teller} he who had given the order to pack up knapsacks and put flints to the guns he told him what had happened and the measures that had been taken [tellier] {teller} [realised] {realized} that all was lost he ran to the [hôtel] {hotel} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [poste] {paste, posse, posts, pose, post} and opening the door shouted out in the midst of the supper party the terrible words all is discovered two officers [peugnet] {} and [bonnillon] {} still [misbelieved] {disbelieved} and offered to go to the barracks indeed they went ten minutes later they ran back the news was but too true and there was only just time for flight and they fled that was how the deputy governor encountered [peugnet] {} and his friends outside the gate of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} for it was [peugnet] {} whom he tried to arrest and who fired the pistol shot which flattened the cross of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [louis] {louts} [pailhès] {} and his supper companions had scarcely left the hotel when carrel and [joubert] {} arrived upon the scene they had come to announce in their turn the discovery of the conspiracy they only found in the dining room [guinard] {} and [henri] {} [scheffer] {} who were just leaving it themselves but not being natives of that country they did not know where to fly [guinard] {} [henri] {} [scheffer] {} and [joubert] {} mounted a carriage and took the road to [mulhouse] {} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [corcelles] {} junior and [bazard] {hazard} set out to meet la [fayette] {layette} in order to turn him back when near [mulhouse] {} carrel [quitted] {quieted, quilted, quitter} his three companions took to horse and returned to [neuf] {} [brisach] {} where his battalion was stationed at the gate of [colmar] {collar} he met [rusconi] {} on the road the same fellow who the evening before had been at [mulhouse] {} general [dermoncourt] {} still waited placing [rusconi] {} as sentinel to bring news to him [rusconi] {} knew carrel and [learnt] {learns, learn} from him that all had been discovered and that the conspirators were fleeing but where will you go asked [rusconi] {} ma [foi] {poi, fob, foe, fog, fop} i shall go to [neuf] {} [brisach] {} to resume my duties that does not seem to me a prudent course i shall keep a look out and at the first alarm i shall decamp have you any money i have a hundred [louis] {louts} belonging to the conspiracy take fifty of them give them to me and then take my horse and go and warn the general the exchange was made and carrel continued his journey on foot while [rusconi] {} reached the general's country house at a gallop the general was just rising [rusconi] {} acquainted him with the failure of the enterprise at [béfort] {} but [dermoncourt] {} refused up to the last to believe it ah well he said the failure of [béfort] {} must mean success at [neuf] {} [brisach] {} but general said [rusconi] {} perhaps the news has already got abroad and measures have been taken to frustrate everything then go to [colmar] {collar} to make inquiries and i will go to [neuf] {} [brisach] {} return here in two [hours'] {hours} time each went his way when [rusconi] {} reached [colmar] {collar} he entered the [café] {cafe} [blondeau] {} for news all was known whilst making his inquiries a magistrate who was a friend of general [dermoncourt] {} found means to warn him that two orders of arrest had been issued one against himself and the other against the general [rusconi] {} did not wait to learn more but set off immediately for [widensollen] {} he arrived at midnight and found the general was sleeping peacefully he had been to [neuf] {} [brisach] {} and had satisfied himself that all attempts at rising were now impossible after what had occurred at [béfort] {} at [rusconi's] {} fresh news and at his wife's urgent entreaty general [dermoncourt] {} decided to leave [widensollen] {} for [heiteren] {} there he sought refuge with a cousin an old army teacher two hours after their departure the soldiers and a magistrate appeared at [widensollen] {} baroness [dermoncourt] {} sent the general word of this by their gardener urging him to fly without a moment's loss of time they discussed the possibility of crossing the [rhine] {shine, thine, whine, rhino} and decided that on the following day they would pretend to go on a hunting excursion among the islands which lay opposite [geiswasser] {} [geiswasser] {} is a small hamlet situated on this side of the [rhine] {shine, thine, whine, rhino} inhabited by fishers and customs officers the pretext was all the more plausible as the islands were teeming with game and general [dermoncourt] {} had together with m [koechlin] {} of [mulhouse] {} rented several of them for shooting at dawn they set out with dogs and guns they had hired the boatmen overnight and found them ready about nine o'clock in a mist which prevented seeing ten paces ahead they embarked and told the boatmen to make for mid stream they landed at one of the islands [rusconi] {} and [dermoncourt] {} alone remained in the boat whilst those who had nothing to be afraid of pretended to go and shoot now my men i have business on the other side the [rhine] {shine, thine, whine, rhino} the general said to the boatmen you must have the goodness to take me across the boatmen looked at each other and smiled willingly general they replied a quarter of an hour later [rusconi] {} and [dermoncourt] {} were in [breisgau] {} when he had put foot on the grand duke of [baden's] {} territory he drew a handful of sovereigns from his pocket and gave them to the boatmen thanks general they replied but there was really no need for that we are true [frenchmen] {} and we would not like to see a brave man like yourself shot these boatmen knew about [béfort] {} and were perfectly aware that they were conducting fugitives and not a hunting party the general retreated to [freiburg] {} and from there he went to [bâle] {bale, bile, bole} on 5 and 6 [january] {} we read the full details of the conspiracy in the papers the name of [dermoncourt] {} took such a prominent part in the proceedings that we were quite sure if he were arrested his arrears of half pay would never be settled these particulars explained his letter and we were able to understand what sort of fine weather to expect after the rain instead of the barometer rising to set fair it had dropped to stormy my poor mother was obliged to keep her umbrella open as [dermoncourt] {} had advised only the umbrella was such a dilapidated one that it no longer served to ward off showers in other words to abandon our metaphor we had come to the end of our resources but hope was still left me you ask from what quarter i will tell you chapter [vii] {via, vie, vim, viz} my hopes disappointment m [deviolaine] {} is appointed forest ranger to the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} his coldness towards me half promises first cloud on my love affairs i go to spend three months with my brother in law at [dreux] {} the news waiting for me on my return [muphti] {} walls and hedges the summer house tennis why i gave up playing it the wedding party in the wood i hoped that [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} would be able to get our comedies and melodramas put upon the stage m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} his father finding that no stir was made about his presence in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} made up his mind to risk returning to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} [adolphe] {} naturally followed his father his departure which under any other circumstances would have filled me with despair now overwhelmed me with delight our ideas being what they were [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} took away our chefs [d'uvre] {} we never doubted that the directors of the various [theatres] {} for which they were destined would receive them with enthusiasm thanks to our two [vaudevilles] {vaudeville} and our drama we would turn aside a tributary of that [pactolus] {} which since 1822 had watered m scribe's dominions i would set sail on that tributary with my mother and rejoin [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} there a career would open before me strewn with roses and bank notes it can be imagined how anxiously i waited [adolphe's] {} first letters these first letters were slow in coming i began to feel uneasy at last one morning the postman (or rather post woman an old dame whom we called mother [colombe] {} ) turned her steps in the direction of our house she held a letter in her hand this letter was in [adolphe's] {} handwriting and bore the [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} postmark the directors for reasons [adolphe] {} could not fathom did not put themselves out to make that fuss over our chefs [d'uvre] {} he thought he had the right to expect of them however [adolphe] {} did not despair of getting them a hearing if he could not succeed in this he would have to submit the manuscripts to the critics which would be most humiliating in spite of the gleams of hope which still shone through the epistle the general tone of the letter was doleful in conclusion [adolphe] {} promised to keep me well posted concerning his doings i awaited a second letter the second letter was more than a month in coming and then alas practically all hope had fled the [dîner] {diner} [d'amis] {} borrowed from m [bouilly] {} had not sufficient plot the major [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [strasbourg] {} was too much like the [soldat] {} [laboureur] {} which had just been played at the [variétés] {} with such great success and as for the [abencérages] {} every boulevard [theatre] {} had received a play on that subject for the last ten fifteen or twenty years even supposing therefore that ours were received it did not carry us far still we had not yet lost all hope in the matter of the [dîner] {diner} [d'amis] {} and the major [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [strasbourg] {} after vain attempts to gain access at the [gymnase] {gymnast} and the [varietés] {} we tried the [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint martin the [ambigue] {} [comique] {} and the [gaieté] {gaiety} as for the unlucky [abencérages] {} its fate was sealed i shed as bitter a tear over it as [boabdil] {} shed over [grenada] {grenade} and i awaited [adolphe's] {} third letter with very gloomy forebodings our cup of humiliation was full to the brim we were refused everywhere but [adolphe] {} had several plays on the way with [théaulon] {} with [soulié] {} and with [rousseau] {trousseau} he was going to try to get them played and when played he would use the influence gained by his success to demand the acceptance of one of our efforts this was but poor comfort and uncertain expectancy i was greatly cast down in the meantime an event had taken place which would have filled me with high spirits under any other circumstances m [deviolaine] {} was appointed keeper of the forests of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} he left [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and went to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to take over the management of the forestry department two ways of helping me lay open to him he could take me into his office or he could give me open air work unluckily since my affair with madame [lebègue] {} the family had given me the cold shoulder this did not discourage my mother who saw an opening for me in one or other of these two careers from approaching m [deviolaine] {} it will be remembered that m [deviolaine] {} although he was not an old soldier could never disguise the truth he replied to my mother why certainly if your rascal of an [alexandre] {} were not an idle lad i could find a berth for him but i confess i have no confidence in him besides after the goings on there have been not necessarily his but in which at all events he has not denied a share everybody here would make a dead set against me still my mother urged her case she saw her last hope fading very well then said m [deviolaine] {} give me some time to think over things and later we will see what can be done i awaited my mother's return with the same impatience with which i had awaited [adolphe's] {} letters the result was not more satisfactory two days before we had received a letter from my brother in law who was a receiver at [dreux] {} he invited me to spend a month or two with him we had become so poor alas that the economy my absence would produce would go a long way towards compensating my mother for her loss at my departure it was moreover my first absence my mother and i had never been parted except during that wonderful visit to [béthisy] {} when the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} [fortier] {forties} had given me my first lessons in hunting there was also another person in the town from whom it was a cruel wrench to tear myself it can be guessed to whom i refer although our liaison had lasted more than three years counting more than a year of preliminary attentions i still loved [adèle] {addle} very dearly and the azure of our sky had hardly had so much as a light cloud upon it during that period an almost unique experience in the annals of a courtship yet the poor girl had been feeling sad for some time while i was but nineteen she was already twenty years old and our love making though delightful child's play not only promised nothing for her future but rather compromised it as no one thought ill of our relations with each other [adèle] {addle} had received two or three offers of marriage all of which she declined either because they did not quite meet her views or because she would not sacrifice our love to them was she not in danger of suffering from the same disappointment which a certain hero of our acquaintance almost a fellow countryman experienced after having despised perch carp and eel would she not be compelled to sup with frogs the prospect was not alluring hence her melancholy poor [adèle] {addle} i perceived that my departure was as necessary for her welfare as for my own we wept abundantly she more than i and it was quite natural she should shed the most tears seeing she was to be consoled the soonest my going away was settled we had now reached the month of [july] {duly, jury} 1822 only another week eight days and eight nights a last week of happiness remained to me for some presentiment warned me that this week would be the last the moment of parting came we vowed fervently never to forget one another for one single hour we promised to write to each other at least twice a week alas we were not rich enough to afford the luxury of a letter a day at last we said our final farewell it was a cruel farewell a separation of hearts even more than a corporeal separation i cannot explain how i got from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to [dreux] {} although i can recollect the most trivial details of my youth almost of my babyhood it is evident i must have gone through [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} since that is the direct route but how could i forget having passed through [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i cannot tell whether i stopped there or not i have not the faintest recollection whether i saw [adolphe] {} or not i know i left [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and i found myself at [dreux] {} if anything could have distracted my attention it would have been that stay with my sister and my brother in law victor as i have already mentioned was a delightful fellow full of wit of repartee of resource but alas there were too empty places in my heart which were difficult to fill i stayed two months at [dreux] {} i was there at the beginning of the shooting season they told me a story of a three legged hare a sort of enchanted creature seen by all sportsmen known by all sportsmen shot at by all sportsmen but after each shot the queer beast shook its ears and only ran the faster this hare was all the better known i might say all the more popular because it was nearly the only one in the countryside we had not gone a quarter of a league from the house on the 1st of [september] {} before a hare rose up near me i gave chase i fired and it rolled over my dog brought it to me it was the three pawed hare the sportsmen of [dreux] {} united in giving me a grand dinner the death of this strange hare and certain shots that brought down two partridges at the same time gave me a reputation in the department of [eure] {cure, lure, pure, sure, euro} [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [loir] {lair, loin} which has lasted until to day but none of these [honours] {honors} showered upon me however exalted they were could make me stay beyond the 15th of [september] {} [adèle's] {} letters had become less and less frequent finally they ceased altogether i left on the 15th of [september] {} i do not remember any more than about my going whether i went back through [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} or not i found myself back at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and the news that met me on my arrival was do you know that [adèle] {addle} [dalvin] {} is going to be married no i had not heard it but it is quite likely i replied oh what were the elegies of [parny] {parry, party} on Éléonore's faithlessness or [bertin's] {} lamentations on the infidelity of [eucharis] {} oh my god how bloodless they seemed when i tried to re read them with my own heart wounded alas poor [adèle] {addle} she was not making a love match she was going to marry a man double her own age he had lived for years in [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} and he had brought home a small fortune [adèle] {addle} was making a prudent marriage i determined to see her the very night i returned you remember how i paid my visits to [adèle] {addle} i entered the usual way by slipping back the bolt of the lock i opened the door i met [muphti] {} again and he gave me such a greeting that he almost betrayed me by his demonstrations then with my heart thumping as it had never yet beaten i scaled the wall and [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} over the two hedges i felt quite ill when i was once more in the garden i [leant] {meant, least, leans, lent, lean} against a tree to get my breath then i went to the pavilion but the nearer i drew and the better i could see things in the darkness the more i felt my heart tighten the shutters were quite wide open instead of being closed the window instead of being shut was half open i [leant] {meant, least, leans, lent, lean} on the window sill everything was dark inside i pushed the two flaps i knelt on the sill the room was empty i felt the bedside with my hands the bed was unoccupied it was evident that [adèle] {addle} had guessed i would come that she had deserted the room leaving it easy for me to gain an entrance therein in order to show me her intentions ah yes i guessed i understood everything what good could it do to meet since all was over between us i sat down on the bed and i gave thanks to god for the gift of tears since he had willed us to endure sorrow the marriage was fixed for fifteen days hence during those fifteen days i kept almost entirely to the house i went to the park on [sunday] {sundry, sundae} but only to play tennis i was very fond of that game as of all games of skill i was rather good at it for i had very strong muscles and i could hold out through the longest game and sometimes even longer this strength of mine was a terror to other players on this particular day when i wanted to overcome my mental feelings by great physical fatigue i gave myself up to the game with a kind of frenzy one ball which i sent as high as a man hit one of the players and knocked him down he was the son of a [brigadier] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [gendarmerie] {} called [savard] {} we ran up to him and found that the ball had luckily hit him on the top of his shoulder a little above the biceps just where the shirt sleeve gatherings come had it gone six inches higher i should have killed him on the spot for it would have reached his temple i threw down my [racquet] {} and i gave up the game i have never played it since i went home and i tried to find distraction in working but i could not set myself to my task one works with heart and mind combined [adolphe] {} had possession of my thoughts [adèle] {addle} was in the act of breaking my heart the wedding day drew near i could not stay in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} on that day i arranged a bird snaring party with an old comrade of mine a playmate of my younger days who had been somewhat neglected since [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [ponce] {nonce, pence, once, pone, pounce} and [adolphe] {} had not only taken hold of my affections but were influencing my life he was a harness maker called [arpin] {} in the evening we went to prepare our tree it was in a lovely copse a quarter of a league or so from the pretty village of [haramont] {} which i have since attempted to make famous in [ange] {ante, age, mange, range, angle} [pitou] {piton} and conscience [l'innocent] {} at the foot of this tree all whose branches we cut off to make way for our lime twigs we built a hut of branches and covered it with fern fronds next day we were at our post before daybreak when the sun rose and shone on our stiff tree we found the sport had begun it was a strange thing that although when younger i had taken such pleasure in this sport that i often lay sleepless the night before this present snaring had no power to distract my heart from the anguish weighing upon it o sorrow thou sublime mystery by which a man's spirit is raised and his soul expanded sorrow without which there would be no poetry for poetry is nearly always made up of joy and hope in equal parts with an equivalent amount of sorrow sorrow which leaves its trace for life a furrow moistened by tears whence prayer springs the mother of those three heavenly noble daughters whose names are faith hope and charity the benediction of a poet is ever thine o sorrow we had taken bread and wine with us we had breakfasted and had dinner the catch was plentiful and would have been entirely satisfactory at any other time we had reached the day's end the hour when the blackbird whistles or the robin sings when the first shadows creep silently to the heart of the wood suddenly i was startled from my reverie (if one can so call a formless chaos of thoughts through which no light had [shone)] {shone} by the sharp sound of a violin and by happy shouts of laughter violin and laughter came nearer and i soon began to see through the trees that a player and a wedding party were coming from [haramont] {} and going towards [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} they were taking a narrow side path and would pass within twenty paces of me young girls in white dresses youths in blue or black clothes with large bouquets and streaming ribbons i put my head out of our hut and uttered a cry this wedding party was [adèle's] {} the young girl with the white veil and the bouquet of orange blossom who walked in front and gave her arm to her husband was [adèle] {addle} her aunt lived at [haramont] {} after mass they had been to the wedding breakfast with the aunt they had gone by the high road in the morning they were returning at night by the shorter way this short cut as i have said ran within twenty paces of our hut what i had fled from had come to find me [adèle] {addle} did not see me she did not know that she was passing near me she was leaning against the shoulder of the man to whom she now belonged in the eyes of man and of god while he had his arm round her waist and held her closely to him i gazed for a long time on that file of white dresses which in the growing darkness looked like a procession of ghosts i heaved a sigh when it had disappeared my first dream had just vanished my first illusion been shattered chapter [viii] {} i leave [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to be second or third clerk at [crespy] {crispy, creepy} m [lefèvre]

[sylla] {} [talma] {} during my absence a place had been offered me as second or third clerk i do not know exactly which with m [lefèvre] {} a lawyer at [crespy] {crispy, creepy} it was a very desirable place because the clerks were lodged and boarded my keep had become such a burden on my poor mother that she consented for the second time to part with me in order to save my food she made up my little bit of packing not much bigger than a [savoyard's] {} on leaving his mountains and off i set it was three and a half leagues from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to [crespy] {crispy, creepy} i did the journey on foot one fine evening and i duly arrived at m [lefèvre's] {} m [lefèvre] {} was at that period a fairly good looking man of thirty four or thirty five with dark brown hair a very pale complexion and a well worn appearance physically you could [recognise] {recognize} he was a man who had lived a long while in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} who had taken many permissible pleasures and still more forbidden ones although m [lefèvre] {} was confined to a little provincial town he might be styled a lawyer of the old school he had ceremonious ways with his clients ceremonious manners with us lofty domineering airs with the world at large m [lefèvre] {} seemed to say to all those who had business with him pray appreciate the [honour] {honor} i am bestowing upon you and your town in condescending to be a lawyer in the capital of a canton when i might have been in practice in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} there was one thing that specially called forth from me feelings of admiration for m [lefèvre] {} and it was this he went to the capital as they call it in [crespy] {crispy, creepy} some eight or ten times a year and he never lowered himself to take the diligence when he wanted a conveyance he would call the gardener [pierre] {pierce} he would say i am going to morrow or this evening to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} see that the post horses are ready in the chaise at such and such an hour [pierre] {pierce} would go at the appointed hour the horses would arrive rousing the whole district with their bells the [postillion] {} who still wore a powdered wig and a blue jacket with red lapels and silver buttons would fling himself clumsily heavily booted into the saddle m [lefèvre] {} would stretch himself nonchalantly in the carriage wrapped in a big cloak take a pinch of snuff from a gold box and say with an air of careless indifference go on and at the word the whip cracked the bells jingled and the carriage disappeared round the corner of the street for three or four days m [lefèvre] {} never told us the day or hour of his return he would return unawares for he delighted in taking his world by surprise but m [lefèvre] {} was not a bad sort of man although cold and exacting he was just he rarely refused holidays when they were asked for but as we shall see he never pardoned holidays taken without leave my brother in law's mother lived at [crespy] {crispy, creepy} so i had a ready entree into the society of that little town alas alas what a different world it was from our three [tiered] {tired} society of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} of which i have spoken and above all from our own charming little circle of friends all the good family of millet with whom we had taken shelter during the first invasion had disappeared the mother the two brothers the two sisters had all left [crespy] {crispy, creepy} and lived in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i have since come across the mother and the eldest sister they were both in want i was dreadfully bored in the heart of that ancient capital of [valois] {} so sick of it that i very often returned home to sleep at my mother's at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} when [saturday] {} evening came taking my gun for a shoot on the way then i would shoulder my gun at six on [monday] {} morning and shooting all the time i returned to [maître] {} [lefèvre's] {} before the office opened thus things went on for three months i had a pretty room looking into a garden full of flowers the evening sun shone into the room i had paper ink and pens in abundance on my table the food was good i looked well enough and yet i felt i could not possibly continue to live thus during one of my [sunday] {sundry, sundae} excursions i turned in the direction of [ermenonville] {} [ermenonville] {} is about six leagues from [crespy] {crispy, creepy} but what were six leagues to such legs as mine i visited the historic places of m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [girardin] {} the desert the poplar island the tomb of the unknown the poetic side to this pilgrimage revived my poor drooping muse a little like a wan sickly butterfly coming out of its chrysalis in [january] {} instead of may i set to work i wrote partly in prose partly in verse and under the inspiration of a charming young society damsel named [athénaïs] {} who knew nothing about it a bad imitation of the [lettres] {} [d'Émilie] {} by [demoustier] {} and of the voyages [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [chevalier] {} [berlin] {} i sent the work to [adolphe] {} when it was finished since i could not achieve success by the stage i might perhaps attain it by publishing i gave it the essentially novel title of [pélerinage] {} à [ermenonville] {} [adolphe] {} naturally enough could not do anything with it he lost it never found it again and so much the better i cannot recollect a single word of it as a matter of fact [adolphe] {} was not succeeding any better than i was all his hopes fell to the ground one after another and he wrote me that we should never do anything unless we were together but to be together it would be necessary to leave [crespy] {crispy, creepy} for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and how was this to be done in the state of my purse which even on those happy days when my mother sent me some money never contained more than eight or ten francs so it was a material impossibility but infinite are the mysteries of providence one [saturday] {} in the month of [november] {} m [lefèvre] {} announced to us in his usual fashion by ordering [pierre] {pierce} to have the horses ready by seven next morning that he was going to pay one of his monthly visits to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} almost simultaneously with his giving this order at the conclusion of dinner (another of his [habits)] {habits} the cook came and told me a friend wanted to see me i went out it was [paillet] {pallet} my old head clerk like myself he had left [maître] {} [mennesson] {} he was living temporarily on his farm at [vez] {fez, viz, vet, vex} where he lodged in the top of a tower compared with which the tower of madame [marlborough] {} however vaunted it may be is a mere trifle the tower of [vez] {fez, viz, vet, vex} was really wonderful the only remains left standing of a stout castle of the twelfth century the ancient nest of vultures now peopled by rooks [paillet] {pallet} had come over on horseback to learn the price of corn i believe he was from time to time head clerk in the provinces or second clerk in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} but his real business his actual life was that of a property owner we took a turn round the ramparts i was in full tide of pouring out my grievances to this good friend who loved me so devotedly and who [sympathised] {sympathized} with me to the utmost when all of a sudden i struck my forehead and burst out with oh my dear fellow i have an idea what is it let us go and spend three days in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and what about the office m [lefèvre] {} goes to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} himself to morrow he usually stays away two or three days we shall have returned in two or three [days'] {days} time [paillet] {pallet} felt in his pockets and drew out twenty eight francs there that is all i possess he said and you i i have seven francs twenty eight and seven make thirty five how the deuce do you think we can go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} on that we need thirty francs to begin with simply for a carriage to get there and back wait a bit i know a way well you have your horse yes we will put our things into a portmanteau we will go in our hunting clothes with our guns and we will shoot along the route we can live on the game and so it will cost us nothing how do you make that out it is simple enough from here to [dammartin] {} surely we can kill a hare two partridges and a quail i hope we can kill more than that so do i hard enough but i am putting it at the lowest when we reach [dammartin] {} we can roast the hinder portion of our hare we can jug the front half and we can drink and eat and then then we will pay for our wine our bread and our seasoning with the two partridges and we will give the quail to the waiter as a tip there will only remain your horse to trouble about come come for three francs a day we shall see wonders but what the [dickens] {sickens, dickers, dickeys} will people take us for what does that matter for scholars on a holiday but we only have one gun that will be all we shall need one of us will shoot the other will follow on horseback in this way as it is only sixteen leagues from here to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} it will only mean eight for each of us and the keepers ah that is our worst difficulty whichever of us is on horseback must keep watch he will warn the one who is poaching the cavalier must dismount from his horse the sportsman will get up spur with both heels and clear out of the place at a gallop the keeper will then come up to the cavalier and finding him walking along with his hands in his pockets will say 'what are you doing here sir ' 'i you can see quite well for yourself ' 'never mind tell me ' 'i am walking ' 'just a minute ago you were on horseback ' 'yes ' 'and now you are on foot ' 'yes is it against the law for a man first to ride and then to walk ' 'no but you were not alone ' 'quite possible ' 'your companion was shooting ' 'do you think so ' 'good heavens why there he is on horseback carrying his gun ' 'my dear sir if he is there with his gun on horseback run after him and try to stop him ' 'but i can't run after him and stop him because he is on horseback and i am on foot ' 'in that case you will be wise my friend to go to the nearest village and drink a bottle of wine to our health ' and at this one of us will hold out a twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} piece to the honest fellow which we will reckon in among our profit and loss the gamekeeper will bow to us go and drink our health and we shall pursue our journey well i never that is not badly conceived cried [paillet] {pallet} they tell me you are writing things i heaved a sigh it is exactly for the purpose of going to ask [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} for news of the plays i have written that i want to go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and then once in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} oh interrupted [paillet] {pallet} once in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i know a little hotel rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} where i usually put up and where i am known once in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i shall not be anxious then it is settled why yes it will be a joke we will start for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} we will very well then better still let us start to night instead of to morrow we can sleep at [ermenonville] {} and to morrow evening leaving [ermenonville] {} early we shall be in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} let us leave to night we went our way [paillet] {pallet} to his inn to have his horse saddled i to [maître] {} [lefèvre's] {} to get my gun and to put on my shooting clothes a shirt a coat a pair of trousers and a pair of boots were sent off by the third clerk to [paillet] {pallet} who stuffed them into a portmanteau these things accomplished i shouldered my gun and awaited [paillet] {pallet} outside the town [paillet] {pallet} soon appeared it was too late for shooting our only thoughts were to gain the country i jumped up behind two hours later we were at [ermenonville] {} it was the second or third time i had visited the [hôtel] {hotel} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [croix] {} so far as i can remember i was not a profitable customer but my antecedents were by no means bad rather the reverse we were well received an [omelette] {} a bottle of wine and as much bread as we wanted constituted our supper next day our account including the horse's stabling came to six francs leaving twenty nine [paillet] {pallet} and i looked at one another as much as to say dear me how money does fly and after two or three sage [noddings] {nodding} of the head we continued our journey going across country to [dammartin] {} where we meant to lunch lunch did not trouble us it lay in the barrel of our gun and we set forth to find it the country round [ermenonville] {} is full of game and well guarded so we had hardly gone a quarter of a league before i had killed two hares and three partridges with six shots of my gun i ought to confess with due humility that these two hares and three partridges belonged to m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [girardin] {} [brégy] {} now when my dog was retrieving the third partridge [paillet] {pallet} gave the prearranged signal the figure of a gamekeeper appeared on the skyline boldly defined against the white fleecy sky like one of those shepherds or country rustics in huge leggings that decamps or [jadin] {jading} put in their landscapes as a contrast to a lonely and twisted elm tree the [manuvre] {} had already been discussed in an instant i was on horseback spurring the horse with both heels and carrying off with me the incriminating plunder the dialogue between [paillet] {pallet} and the gamekeeper was lengthy and animated but it ended as i had predicted [paillet] {pallet} majestically drew a twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} piece from the common purse and our total expenditure had reached the sum of seven francs that was our loss but on the profit side of our account we had two hares and three partridges [paillet] {pallet} joined me again i remained on horseback and he took his turn at hunting so we alternated by ten o'clock in the morning we were at [dammartin] {} with three hares and eight partridges of the two gamekeepers we ran across since our last one had loftily refused the twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} the other had basely accepted our funds were now reduced to twenty seven francs but we were more than half way there and we had three hares and eight partridges to the good as i had foreseen we paid our way and generously with a hare and three partridges we could have paid our way in larks by eleven o'clock we were off again and we made straight tracks for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} which we reached at half past ten that night i on foot and [paillet] {pallet} on horseback with four hares a dozen partridges and two quails we had a marketable value of thirty francs of game with us when we reached the [hôtel] {hotel} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} [paillet] {pallet} made himself known and imposed his conditions he told our host we had made a big bet with some [englishmen] {} we had wagered that we could go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and back without spending a halfpenny so we wished to gain the bet by selling our game to him he engaged to board and put us up horse and dog included for two days and two nights in exchange for our twelve partridges four hares and two quails besides this when we left he put us up a pasty and bottle of wine on these conditions our host declared he would make a good thing out of us and offered us a certificate to certify that at least while with him we had not spent a son we thanked him and told him our [englishmen] {} would take our word for it [paillet] {pallet} and i took our bearings and went to get a bath with all economy possible we had had to deduct the sum of three francs fifty from our remaining balance we were thus left with twenty three francs fifty we had spent rather less than a third of our wealth but we had arrived and bed and board were assured us for forty eight hours in spite of the fatigue of the journey i slept but ill i was in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i envied my dog who laid down at the foot of my bed free from imagination tired out in body and indifferent to his resting place was taking a nap next day i woke up at seven o'clock in a twinkling i was dressed [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} lived in the rue [pigale] {} no 14 it was nearly a league from the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} but good gracious what did that matter i had covered ten or a dozen leagues the day before without reckoning the ins and outs and i could surely manage one to day i set out [paillet] {pallet} had business of his own to attend to i had mine we should probably meet at dinner time or perhaps not until night i left the rue [des'] {desk} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} by the rue [croix] {} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [petits] {petite, petites} champs and walked straight ahead i saw a passage where a crowd of people were going in and coming out i went down seven or eight steps until i thought i was lost i wanted to ascend again but i felt ashamed i continued on my way and alighted on the rue [valois] {} i had made acquaintance first go off with the ugliest passage in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} the passage of the rue [neuve] {nerve} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [bons] {cons, dons, eons, ions, sons} [enfants] {infants} i went down another passage which opened out before me and i found myself in the [palais] {} royal i went all round it half the shops weren't opened i stopped in front of the [théâtre] {} [français] {} and i saw on the poster to morrow [monday] {} [sylla] {} a tragedy in verse in five acts by m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} i vowed fervently that somehow or other i would get access to the common purse and i would see [sylla] {} all the more because i read in large letters on the same poster m [talma] {} will take the part of [sylla] {} however since it would be much better to go with the [help'] {helps, help, help's} of [adolphe] {} i immediately inquired my way to the rue [pigale] {} and started off for it after many [turnings] {turning} and [twistings] {twisting} i reached my destination at about nine in the morning [adolphe] {} was not yet up but his father was walking in the garden i went up to him he stopped let me approach held out his hand to me and said so you have come to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} then yes monsieur [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} for some stay for two days what have you come for i have come to see two people [adolphe] {} and [talma] {} ah is that so you have become a millionaire then or you would not commit such extravagances i told m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} how [paillet] {pallet} and i had accomplished the journey he looked at me for a minute then he said you will get on you have will power go and wake [adolphe] {} he will take you to see [talma] {} who will give you tickets then come back and lunch together here that was the very thing i wanted i took stock of the interior topography of the house and rushed off i only opened two wrong doors before i found [adolphe's] {} one was [gabriel] {} [arnault's] {} door the other [louis] {louts} [arnault's] {} i lost my way on the first landing [louis] {louts} put me right i reached [adolphe's] {} room at last [adolphe] {} slept like the seven sleepers but had i had to deal with [epimenides] {} i would have wakened him [adolphe] {} rubbed his eyes and could not [recognise] {recognize} me come come i said it is really i wake up and get dressed i want to go to [talma] {} to [talma] {} what for you don't mean to say you have a tragedy to read to him no but i want to ask him for some tickets what is he playing in now i fell from my state of exaltation [adolphe] {} living in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} did not know what [talma] {} was acting what was the idiot thinking of no wonder he had not yet got my [pélerinage] {} [d'ermenonville] {} placed or any of our plays acted [adolphe] {} got out of bed and dressed himself at eleven o'clock we were ringing the bell of a house in the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la tour [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} dames mademoiselle mars mademoiselle [duchesnois] {} and [talma] {} all lived side by side [talma] {}

i naturally behind [adolphe] {} [talma] {} was extremely short sighted i do not know whether he saw me or not he was washing his chest his head was almost shaved this astonished me greatly for i had heard it said many times that in hamlet when the father's ghost appears [talma's] {} hairs could be seen standing on end i must confess that [talma's] {} appearance under the above conditions was far from being artistic but when he turned round with his neck bare the lower part of his body wrapped in a large sort of white linen wrapper and he took one of the corners of this mantle and drew it over his shoulder half veiling his breast there was something so regal in the action that it made me tremble [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} laid bare our request [talma] {} took up a kind of antique stiletto at the end of which was a pen and signed an order for two seats for us it was a member's order besides the [actors'] {actors} order which were received on days when they were acting

besides [talma] {} remembered having met my father at saint [georges's] {} he held out his hand to me and i longed to kiss it full of theatrical ambitions as i was [talma] {} was like a god to me an

procuring another by the means of it i would not have parted with it for five hundred francs i was filled with pride at the thought of going to the [théâtre] {} [français] {} with an order signed [talma] {} we lunched [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} raised great difficulties about going to the play he had an engagement with scribe a meeting with [théaulon] {} an appointment with i don't know how many other celebrities besides that night his father shrugged his shoulders and [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} raised no more objections it was arranged that we were to go

arranged to meet me at the [café] {cafe} [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [roi] {poi, rob, rod, roe, rot} at seven o'clock the [café] {cafe} [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [roi] {poi, rob, rod, roe, rot} formed the corner of the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [richelieu] {} and the rue saint [honoré] {honors, honor} we shall have more to say about it later after luncheon i set out by myself and went to the

{cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [roi] {poi, rob, rod, roe, rot} not comprehending how there could be anything more vitally important than to see [talma] {} or if one had already seen him than to see him again i reached our rendezvous some minutes before [adolphe] {} [paillet] {pallet} had foreseen that i should probably have some indispensable expenses he had generously drawn three francs from the common

table i calculated what would cost me the least i concluded that a small glass of brandy would give me the right to wait and at least to look as though i was a [habitué] {habitue} of the establishment so i ordered one now i had never managed to swallow one drop of that abominable liquor however although obliged to order it i was not obliged to drink it i had scarcely taken my seat when i saw one of the regular customers (i judged he was a regular attender because i saw that he had nothing at all on the table before [him)] {hims, him} get up and come towards me i uttered a cry of surprise and joy it was [lafarge] {} [lafarge] {} had gone a step lower towards poverty he wore a coat shiny at the elbows trousers shiny at the knees why surely i am not mistaken it is really you he said it is really i sit down here with pleasure ask for another glass for you yes take mine my dear fellow i never touch brandy then why did you ask for it because i did not like to wait till [adolphe] {} came in without asking for something is [adolphe] {} coming here yes we are going to see [sylla] {} together what you are going to see that filth filth [sylla] {} why it is an enormous success yes the success of a wig the success of a wig i echoed not understanding certainly take away from [sylla] {} his [napoleonic] {} locks and the piece would never be played through but surely m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} is a great poet in the provinces he may be thought great my dear boy but here we are in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and we see things differently if he is not a great poet he is at least a man of infinite resource well perhaps he might have been thought clever under the empire but you see my boy the wit of 1809 is not the wit of 1822 still i thought that [l'ermite] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [chaussée] {} [d'antin] {} was written under the restoration why certainly but do you think [l'ermite] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [chaussée] {} [d'antin] {} was by m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} most certainly since it appears under his name oh what sweet simplicity then who wrote it why [merle] {merge, mere} who is [merle] {merge, mere} hush he is that gentleman you see over there in a big coat and a wide brimmed hat he has ten times more wit than m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} but if he has ten times m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy's] {joy's} wit how is it he has not a quarter of his reputation oh because you see my boy reputations as you will find later are not made either by wit or talents but by coteries just ask for the sugar brandy makes me ill if i drink it neat waiter some sugar but if brandy upsets you why drink it what else can one do said [lafarge] {} if one passes one's life in [cafés] {cafes} one must drink something so you spend all your time in [cafés] {cafes} nearly all i can work best so in the midst of all the noise and talking i am used to that [théaulon] {} works thus [francis] {francs} works thus [rochefort] {} works thus we all work thus don't we [théaulon] {} a man of thirty to thirty five who had been writing rapidly on quarto paper something that looked like dialogue at this [interpellation] {} lifted up his pale face red about the cheek bones and looked at us kindly yes he said what is it ah it is you [lafarge] {} good evening and he resumed his work is that [théaulon] {} i asked yes there's a man of ready wit for you only he squanders and abuses his ready wit do you know what he is doing now no he is writing a comedy in five acts in verse what he can write poetry here in a [café] {cafe} in the first place dear boy this is not a [café] {cafe} it is a kind of literary club everybody you see here is either an author or a journalist well i said to [lafarge] {} i have never seen a [café] {cafe} where they consumed so little and wrote so much the deuce you are framing already you almost made a witticism just then do you know well then in return for the witticism i have almost perpetrated tell me who some of these gentlemen are my dear fellow it would be useless you need to be a [parisian] {} to be acquainted with reputations which are wholly [parisian] {} but i assure you my dear [auguste] {august, auguster} i am not so provincial in such matters as you think i am have you heard of [rochefort] {} yes has he not composed some very pretty songs and two or three successful [vaudevilles] {vaudeville} exactly so very well he is that tall thin man who is playing dominoes both players are of equal thinness ah quite true he is the one whose face always plays and never wins a way [rochefort] {} had gave rise to this joke on the part of his friend [lafarge] {} i say gave rise to and not excused and who is his partner that is [ferdinand] {} [langlé] {} ah little [fleuriet's] {} lover little [fleuriet's] {} lover hang it you talk like a [parisian] {} who has primed you so well hang it all [adolphe] {} he does not appear to hurry himself you are in a hurry then of course i am and naturally enough i have never seen [talma] {} ah well dear boy hurry up and see him why do you say that because he is wearing out horribly what do you mean by wearing out i mean he is getting old and growing rusty i see but the papers say he has never been fresher in talent or more beautiful in facial expression do you believe what the papers say oh you may be a journalist yourself one day my boy well if i am why then when you are you will see how things come about and and you will not believe what the papers say that is all at this moment the door opened and [adolphe] {} poked his head in be quick he said if we do not hurry we shall find the curtain raised oh it is you at last i darted towards [adolphe] {} you have forgotten to pay said [lafarge] {} oh so i have waiter how much one small glass four [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} six [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} of sugar ten i drew ten [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} from my pocket and flung them on the table and then the lighter by fifty centimes i rushed out of the [café] {cafe} you were with [lafarge] {} said [adolphe] {} yes what is wrong with him what do you mean by what is wrong with him he told me that m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} was an idiot and [talma] {} a [cassandra] {} poor [lafarge] {} said [adolphe] {} perhaps he had not dined not dined is he reduced so low as that pretty nearly ah i said that explains many things mm [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} and [talma] {} dine every day and poor [lafarge] {} cannot forgive them for it alas i have since seen critics besides [lafarge] {} who could not forgive those who dined i had dined so well that i had quite as much of the spirit of indulgence in my stomach as curiosity in my mind we went into the [theatre] {} the hall was crowded although it was about the eighth performance of the play we had terrible difficulty in obtaining seats our places were unreserved [adolphe] {} generously gave forty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} to the woman who showed people to their seats and she wriggled a way in so well for us that she found us a corner in the [centre] {} of the orchestra into which we slipped like a couple of wedges which we must have resembled in shape and appearance we were only just in time as [adolphe] {} had said scarcely were we

blushing vividly and very humble [talma] {} said [adolphe] {} we have come to thank you [talma] {} looked round out of his eye corners he perceived me at the door ah ah he said come in i took two steps towards him well [mr] {fr, gr, hr, or, yr} poet said he were you satisfied i am more than that monsieur i am wonder struck very well you must come and see me again and ask for more seats alas monsieur [talma] {} i leave [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to morrow or the day after at latest that is a pity you might have seen me in [régulus] {} you know i have put [régulus] {} on the bill for the day after to morrow [lucien] {} yes [lucien] {} replied and cannot you stop till the evening of the day after to morrow impossible i have to return to the provinces what do you do in the provinces i dare not tell you lama lawyer's clerk and i heaved a deep sigh bah said [talma] {} you must not give way to despair on that account [corneille] {} was clerk to a procurator gentlemen allow me to introduce you to a future [corneille] {} i blushed to the eyes lay your hand on my forehead it will bring me good luck i said to [talma] {} [talma] {} laid his hand on my head there so be it he said [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} i baptize thee poet in the name of [shakespeare] {} of [corneille] {} and of [schiller] {chiller} go back to the provinces go back to your office and if you really have a vocation the angel of poetry will know how to find you all right wherever you be will carry you off by the hair of your head like the prophet [habakkuk] {} and will take you where fate determines i took [talma's] {} hand and tried to kiss it why see he said the lad has enthusiasm and will make something of himself and he shook me cordially by the hand i had nothing more to wait for there a longer stay in that dressing room crowded with celebrities would have been both embarrassing and ridiculous i made a sign to [adolphe] {} and we took our leave i wanted to fling my arms round [adolphe's] {} neck in the corridor yes indeed i said to him be sure i shall return to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} you may depend upon that we went down by the little twisting staircase which has since been condemned we left by the black corridor we went along the gallery then called the [galerie] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [nemours] {} and called to day i know not what and we came out on the place [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [palais] {} royal there you know your way said [adolphe] {} the rue [croix] {} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [petits] {petite, petites} champs the rue [coquillière] {} the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} good night i must leave you it is late and it is a long way from here to the rue [pigale] {} by the way remember we lunch at ten and we dine at five and [adolphe] {} turned round the corner of the rue [richelieu] {} and disappeared it was indeed late all lights were out and only a few belated people were passing across the place [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [palais] {} royal although [adolphe] {} had told it me i did not in the least know my way and i was extremely scared when i found myself alone it must be confessed i felt very uneasy at being out in the streets of [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} at such a late hour for i had heard heaps of stories of night attacks robberies and assassinations and with my fifty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} in my pocket i trembled at the thought of being plundered a struggle went on in my mind between courage and fear fear won the day i hailed a cab the cab came up to me and i opened the door monsieur knows it is past midnight said the driver of course i know it i replied and i added to myself that is the very reason i am taking a cab where is the country squire going rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} [hôtel] {hotel} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} what said the driver i repeated it is monsieur quite sure he wants to go there the deuce i do in that case off we go and lashing his horses at the same time clicking with his tongue as do all drivers he urged them into a canter twenty seconds later he pulled up got down from his seat and opened the door well i asked well my country lad we are at your destination rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} [hôtel] {hotel} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} i raised my head and there beyond doubt was the house i then understood the driver's astonishment at seeing a great bumpkin of twenty who seemed in no way unsound of limb wanting to take a cab from the place [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [palais] {} royal to go to the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} but as it would have been too absurd to avow that i did not know the distance between the two places i said in a stout voice all right what is the fare oh you know the fare well enough young fellow if i knew it i should not ask you it is fifty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} then fifty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} i exclaimed horrified at having incurred such useless expense certainly young chap that is the tariff fifty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} to come from the [palais] {} royal here i warned monsieur it was past midnight there you are i said take your fifty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} aren't you going to give me a [pourboire] {} young fellow i made a movement to strangle the wretch but he was strong and vigorous i reflected that perhaps he would strangle me so i stayed my hand i rang the bell the door was opened and i went inside i felt dreadfully stricken with remorse for having squandered my money especially when i considered that even had [paillet] {pallet} spent nothing on his side we only had twenty francs fifty centimes left [paillet] {pallet} had been to the opera and had spent eight francs ten [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} only a dozen francs were left us we looked at each other with some anxiety listen he said you have seen [talma] {} i have heard la [lampe] {lamps, lame, lamp} [mervilleuse] {} this was all you wanted to see all i wanted to hear if you agree let us leave to morrow instead of the next day that is exactly what i was going to suggest to you all right do not let us lose any time it is now one o'clock let us get to bed as quickly as possible and sleep until six then let us start at seven and sleep if we can manage it at [manteuil] {} good night good night a quarter of an hour later we were [rivalling] {rivaling, rivaling} one another who could go to sleep the soundest next day or rather the same day at eight o'clock we had passed [villette] {} at three o'clock we were dining at [dammartin] {} under the same conditions as we had lunched there at seven we were having our supper at [manteuil] {} and on [wednesday] {} at one o'clock loaded with two hares and six partridges the result of the economy we had exercised by our hunting of the previous night and day we entered [crespy] {crispy, creepy} giving our last twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} to a poor beggar [paillet] {pallet} and i parted at the entry to the large square i went to [maître] {} [lefèvre's] {} by the little passage and up to my room to change my things i called [pierre] {pierce} through the window and asked him for news of m [lefèvre] {} m [lefèvre] {} had returned in the night i gave my game to the cook went into the office and slipped into my place my three office companions were all in their places nobody asked me a question they thought i had just returned from one of my usual excursions only one that had lasted rather longer than usual i [enquired] {inquired} if m [lefèvre] {} had asked any questions about me m [lefèvre] {} had wanted to know where i was they had replied that they did not know and the matter had ended there i drew my papers from my desk and set to work a few minutes later m [lefèvre] {} appeared he went to the head clerk gave him some instructions and then returned to his room without even having seemed to notice my presence which led me to think he had taken particular notice of my absence dinner time arrived we sat down all went on as usual save that after dinner when i was rising to go m [lefèvre] {} said to me monsieur [dumas] {pumas, dumps} i want a few words with you i knew the storm was about to burst and i resolved to keep myself well in hand certainly monsieur i replied the head clerk and the office boy who shared the master's table with me discreetly withdrew m [lefèvre] {} pointed to a chair opposite his own on the other side of the fireplace i sat down then m [lefèvre] {} lifted his head as a horse does under the [martingale] {} a gesture which was customary with him crossed his right leg over his left leg held up one leg till the slipper fell took his gold snuff box inhaled a pinch of snuff drew a dignified breath and then in a voice all the more threatening because of its dulcet tones he said scratching his right foot with his left hand his most cherished habit monsieur [dumas] {pumas, dumps} have you any knowledge of mechanics not in theory monsieur only in practice well then you will know enough to understand my illustration i am listening monsieur monsieur [dumas] {pumas, dumps} in order that a machine may work properly none of its wheels must stop of course not monsieur very well monsieur [dumas] {pumas, dumps} i need not say more i am the engineer you are one of the wheels in the machine for two days you have stopped and consequently for two days the general action of the machine has lacked the [co] {do, go, ho, lo, mo} operation of your individual movement i rose to my feet quite so monsieur i said you will understand added m [lefèvre] {} in a less dogmatic tone that this warning is merely provisional you are very good monsieur but i take it as definitive oh then that is better still said m [lefèvre] {} it is now seven in the evening night is coming on and the weather is bad but you may leave when you like my dear [dumas] {pumas, dumps} from the moment you cease to be third clerk here you can remain as a friend and in that capacity the longer you stay the better i shall be pleased i bowed a graceful acknowledgment to m [lefèvre] {} and withdrew to my room i had taken a great step and an important career was now closed to me henceforth my future was in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and i made up my mind to move heaven and earth to leave the provinces i spent half the night in thinking and before i fell asleep all my plans were made book [iii] {} chapter i i return to my mother's the excuse i give concerning my return the calf's lights [pyramus] {} and [cartouche] {} the intelligence of the fox more developed than that of the dog death of [cartouche] {} [pyramus's] {} various gluttonous habits i packed up my things next day and went i was not without uneasiness with regard to the way my mother might receive me my poor mother her first expression at seeing me was always one of delight but my leaving [maître] {} [lefèvre's] {} would trouble her so the nearer i drew to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} the slower did my steps become it generally took me two hours to walk the three and a half leagues between [crespy] {crispy, creepy} and [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} for i used to run the last league but now the reverse was the case for the last league took me the longest of all to cover i returned in shooting costume after my usual fashion and my dog was hardly three hundred yards away before he smelt home stopped an instant lifted up his nose and set off like an arrow five seconds after he had disappeared down the road i saw my mother appear on the threshold my courier had preceded me and announced my return she met me with her usual smile the whole tenderness of her heart welled up at my approach and shone in her face i flung myself in her arms oh what a love is a mother's a love always good always devoted always faithful a true diamond lost [amongst] {} all the false stones with which youth decks its happiness a pure and limpid carbuncle which shines in joy as in sorrow by night as by day my mother's first thoughts were [nought] {bought, fought, sought, naught, nougat} but joyful ones at seeing me again then at last she asked me how it was i had returned home on [thursday] {} instead of on [saturday] {} to spend [sunday] {sundry, sundae} with her going back on [monday] {} as usual i dared not tell her of the misfortune that had befallen me i told her that as business was slack at the office i had obtained a holiday for several days which i meant to spend with her but my mother observed i see you are wearing your hunting coat and breeches yes why not how is it you have nothing in your game bag it was not indeed customary for me to return with the game bag empty i was so anxious to see you dear mother that instead of shooting i came the shortest way by the high road i lied had i spoken the truth i should have said alas dear mother i was so much taken up with thinking what effect my news would have upon you that i never thought of shooting though at other times i have forgotten everything for that passion but had i told her that i should have had to tell her the news and i wanted to delay it as long as possible an incident freed me from embarrassment and diverted my mother's thoughts for the moment i heard my dog howl i ran to the door the next house to ours was that of a butcher called [mauprivez] {} in the front of the butcher's slab there was a long cross bar of painted wood in which at different intervals iron hooks were fixed to hold various specimens of meat in jumping up at a [calfs] {calks, calls, calms, calf} lights [pyramus] {} had got hooked like a carp on a fish hook and hung suspended that was why he howled and as will readily be imagined not without cause i seized hold of him by the body unhooked him and he rushed into the stable his jaws bleeding if i ever write the history of the dogs that have belonged to me [pyramus] {} shall have a prominent place by the side of [milord] {} i may therefore be allowed to leave in suspense the interest my return naturally created to talk a bit about [pyramus] {} who in spite of his name which indicated that all sorts of love misfortunes were before him had never had to my knowledge any misadventures except gastronomic ones [pyramus] {} was a large chestnut [coloured] {colored} dog of very good french pedigree who had been given me when quite a puppy with a fox cub of the same age which the keeper who gave him me (it was poor [choron] {} of la [maison] {mason} [neuve)] {} had had suckled by the same mother i often amused myself by watching the different instincts of these two animals develop as they were placed opposite one another in the yard in two parallel recesses for the first three or four months an almost brotherly intimacy reigned between [cartouche] {} and [pyramus] {} i need not mention that [cartouche] {} was the fox and [pyramus] {} the dog nor need i mention that the name of [cartouche] {} was given to the fox in allusion to his instincts of stealing and depredation it was [cartouche] {} who began to declare war on [pyramus] {} although he was the weaker looking this declaration of war took place over some bones which were within [cartouche's] {} boundary but which [pyramus] {} had surreptitiously tried to annex the first time [pyramus] {} attempted this piracy [cartouche] {} snarled the second time he showed his teeth the third time he bit [cartouche] {} was the more to be excused because he was always on the chain while [pyramus] {} had his hours of liberty [cartouche] {} restrained to a very circumscribed walk could not therefore at full length of his chain do unto [pyramus] {} the evil deeds which [pyramus] {} abusing his liberty was guilty of on his side on account of this captivity i was able to notice the superior intelligence of the fox over that of the dog both were gourmands in the highest degree with this difference that [pyramus] {} was more of a glutton and [cartouche] {} more of an epicure when they both stretched to the full length of their chains they could reach a distance of nearly four feet from the opening of their recesses add ten inches for the length of [pyramus's] {} head four inches for [cartouche's] {} pointed nose and you will arrive at this result that whilst [pyramus] {} at the length of his chain could reach a bone at four feet ten inches from his recess [cartouche] {} could only perpetrate the same deed four feet four inches from his very well if i placed a bone six feet off that is to say out of the reach of both [pyramus] {} had to content himself with stretching his chain with the whole strength of his sturdy shoulders but not being able to break it he would stand with fixed bloodshot eyes his jaws slobbering and open attempting from time to time with plaintive whines to exorcise the distance or by desperate efforts to break his chain if the bone were not either taken away or given him he would have gone mad but he had never succeeded by any ingenious contrivance to snatch the prey beyond his reach it was another matter with [cartouche] {} his preliminary tactics were the same as those of [pyramus] {} and consequently equally fruitless but soon he began to reflect rubbing a paw on his nose then all at once as though a sudden illumination had come into his mind he turned himself round adding the length of his body to the length of his chain dragged the bone into the circle of his kingdom by the help of one of his hind paws turned round again seized hold of the bone and entered into his kennel from which it was not rejected until it was as clean and polished as ivory [pyramus] {} saw [cartouche] {} perform this trick ten times he would howl with jealousy as he listened to his comrade's teeth grinding on the bone which he was gnawing but i repeat he never had the intelligence to do the same thing himself and to use his hind paw as a hook to draw the tit bit within his reach [cartouche] {} was of superior intelligence to [pyramus] {} in a thousand other instances such as this although his [tractability] {} was always inferior but it is common knowledge that with animals as with human beings the capacity for being trained is not always nay is scarcely ever combined with intelligence the reader may ask why the injustice was perpetrated of keeping [cartouche] {} always fastened while [pyramus] {} was allowed his liberty at times this is why [pyramus] {} was only a glutton by need while [cartouche] {} was destructive by instinct one day he broke his chain and went from our yard into the farmyard belonging to our [neighbour] {neighbor} [mauprivez] {} in less than ten minutes he had strangled seventeen fowls and two cocks nineteen cases of homicide it was impossible to plead extenuating circumstances he was condemned to death and executed so [pyramus] {} reigned sole master of the place which to his shame be it said he appreciated greatly his appetite seemed to increase when he was left alone this appetite was a defect at home but out shooting it was a vice nearly always the first game i killed under his nose were it small game such as partridge young pheasant or quail would be lost to me his big jaws would open and with a rapid gulp the piece of game disappeared down his throat very rarely did i arrive in time to perceive by opening his jaws the last feathers of the bird's tail disappearing in the depths of his gullet then a lash with my horse whip vigorously applied on the loins of the guilty sinner would cure him for the remainder of the chase and it was seldom he repeated the same fault but between one shoot and another he generally had time to forget the previous punishment and more expenditure of whipcord was needed on two other occasions however the gluttony of [pyramus] {} turned out badly for him one day [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} and i were shooting over the marshes of [pondron] {} it was a place where two harvests were gathered during the year the first harvest was that of a small thicket of [alderwood] {} the owner of the land after having cut his branches stripped the twigs off sawed it and tied it in bundles then he became busy over his second harvest which was that of hay they were just reaping this crop but as it was luncheon time the reapers had rested their scythes here and there and were feeding by a small river wherein they could moisten their hard bread one of them had placed his scythe against one of the heaps of cut wood about two feet and a half high placed in cubic [metres] {metros, meres, metes} or half [mètres] {} i put up a snipe i fired and killed it and it fell behind this pile of wood against which the scythe was propped it was the first thing i had killed that day consequently it happened to be the perquisite [pyramus] {} was in the habit of appropriating so putting two and two together he had scarcely seen the snipe stopped in its flight fall vertically behind the wood pile before he darted over the stack so as to fall on the spot as soon as it did without loss of time as i knew beforehand that it was a head of game lost i did not hurry myself to see the tail feathers of my snipe in the depths of [pyramus's] {} throat but to my great surprise i saw no more of [pyramus] {} than if he had tumbled down an invisible chasm [hewn] {sewn, hews, hen, hew} out behind the pile of wood when i had re loaded my gun i decided to fathom this mystery [pyramus] {} had fallen on the far side of the heap of wood his neck on the point of the scythe this point had penetrated to the right of the pharynx behind the neck and stuck out four inches in front poor [pyramus] {} could not stir and was [bleeding'] {bleeding, bleeding's} to death the snipe intact was within six inches of his nose [adolphe] {} and i raised him up so as to cause him the least possible hurt we carried him to the river and we bathed him in deep water then i made him a compress with my handkerchief folded in sixteen which we bound round his neck with [adolphe's] {} silk one then seeing a peasant from [haramont] {} passing with a donkey carrying two baskets we put [pyramus] {} in one of the [paniers] {panders, panniers, panniers} and we had him carried to [haramont] {} whence next day i took him away in a small conveyance [pyramus] {} was a week between life and death for a month he carried his head on one side like prince [tuffiakin] {} finally at the end of six weeks he had regained his elasticity of movement and appeared to have completely forgotten the terrible catastrophe but whenever he saw a scythe he made an immense detour to avoid coming in contact with it another day he returned home his body as full of holes as a sieve he had been wandering about the forest alone watching his opportunity and he had [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} at the throat of a hare the hare screamed out a keeper who was about a couple of hundred steps away ran up but before the keeper could clear the two hundred paces the hare was half devoured now [pyramus] {} on seeing the approach of the keeper and on hearing his [execrations] {} understood that something alarming would occur between himself and the man in blue clothes he took to his heels and set off full tear but as [friday] {} of [robinson] {} [crusoe] {} memory remarked small shot ran after me faster than you did the keeper's small shot [travelled] {traveled, traveled} faster than [pyramus] {} and [pyramus] {} returned home riddled in eight places i have already related what happened to him ten minutes after my return a week later he came in with a calf's lights in his mouth a knife was quivering in his side behind him came one of the [mauprivez'] {} sons ah he said isn't it enough that your beastly [pyramus] {} carries away the contents of our shop joint by joint but he must needs carry away my knife too seeing [pyramus] {} carry off the [calfs] {calks, calls, calms, calf} lights [mauprivez'] {} boy had hurled at him the knife butchers generally wear at their girdles but as the knife went three or four inches into [pyramus's] {} hide [pyramus] {} had carried off both meat and knife [mauprivez] {} recovered his implement but the [calfs] {calks, calls, calms, calf} lights were already devoured just when [pyramus's] {} various misdeeds had incurred not merely our individual [reprobation] {} but public [reprobation] {} still more an advantageous occasion offered to get rid of him but as that occasion was invested in my eyes with all the semblance of a miracle i must be permitted to relate that miracle in its proper time and place and not to anticipate it here let us for the moment occupy ourselves over the unexpected return of the prodigal son to the maternal roof a return from which [pyramus] {} and [cartouche] {} have incidentally diverted our attention chapter [ii] {hi, mi, pi, ti, id} hope in [laffitte] {} a false hope new projects m [lecornier] {} how and on what conditions i clothe myself anew [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} tailor 12 rue [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [helder] {welder, holder, header, helper, elder} [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i visit our estate along with him [pyramus] {} follows a butcher lad an [englishman] {} who loved gluttonous dogs i sell [pyramus] {} my first hundred francs the use to which they are put [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} departs for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} open credit although i had told my mother that my return was only a provisional one to use m [lefèvre's] {} expression she had very little doubt at heart that it was really final her doubt turned to certainty when she saw [sunday] {sundry, sundae} [monday] {} [tuesday] {} pass by without my speaking of returning to [crespy] {crispy, creepy} but poor mother she never said a word to me concerning this catastrophe it had cost her so much to part with me that since god had sent me back to her she opened her maternal heart arms and door to me i had some hope left me [adolphe] {} had promised to make overtures to m [laffitte] {} the banker on my behalf if m [laffitte] {} made me an opening in his office where they worked from ten to four there would be the whole of the evening and early morning to oneself for other work besides it was time i should earn something the most important thing was to get to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to light our poor candles at that universal vast and dazzling fireside which was a light to the whole world a fortnight after my return from [crespy] {crispy, creepy} i received a letter from [adolphe] {} his request had come to nothing for m [laffitte's] {} offices were over full of clerks as it was they were talking of clearing some out so i decided to put in action at the first opportunity a plan i had settled upon during the last sleepless night i had spent at m [lefèvre's] {} this project was perfectly simple and by its very simplicity seemed likely to succeed i would select from my father's desk a dozen letters from marshal [jourdan] {} marshal victor marshal [sébastiani] {} from all the marshals still living in fact with whom my father had had dealings i would collect a small sum of money and i would start for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i would approach these old friends of my father they would do what they could and it would be a strange thing if four or five marshals of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} one of whom was minister for war could not by their combined influence find a situation at 1200 francs for the son of their old comrade in arms but although this plan looked as simple and artless at the first glance as a pastoral by [florian] {florin} it was very difficult to put in execution small though the sum was it was not an easy thing to raise it moreover an expenditure i had foolishly made at [crespy] {crispy, creepy} complicated matters i had become connected at [crespy] {crispy, creepy} with a young man who had lived in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} his name was [lecornier] {} he was brother of that gracious person to whom i gave a name in one of my preceding chapters you will recollect it although it was only mentioned once the charming name of [athénaïs] {} or in other words [athena] {} [minerva] {} [pallas] {palls} although the bearer of it was quite unaware of this fact well ashamed of moving in the aristocratic world of [crespy] {crispy, creepy} in my old fashioned clothes of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i had asked [lecornier] {} as my build was exactly his to write to his tailor to make me a coat a waistcoat and a pair of trousers [lecornier] {} wrote i sent my twenty francs as a remittance on account and fifteen days later the tailor forwarded me the goods enclosing a bill for a hundred and fifty five francs from which he had deducted the twenty francs i had sent him on account it was arranged that the rest of the bill should be liquidated at the rate of twenty francs a month the tailor's name was [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} and he lived in the rue [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [helder] {welder, holder, header, helper, elder} no 12 it will be seen from his charges that although [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} lived in a fashionable quarter he was neither a [chevreuil] {} nor a [staub] {stub, stab} no he was a journeyman who charged fancy prices who had drifted from the [latin] {satin, lain} quarter where he should always have remained but for the very reason that his business was small [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} had all the more need of the profits it produced although i exercised the greatest economy possible i had not been able to put aside the promised twenty francs when the next month's payment became due not having them of course i could not send them this first infraction of our treaty made [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} very uneasy nevertheless [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} knew that [lecornier] {} belonged to a family well to do although not wealthy [lecornier] {} kept his engagements with him with scrupulous punctuality so he decided to wait before giving signs of his anxiety the second month came with it came the same impossibility on my part and consequently redoubled uneasiness on the part of [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} meanwhile i had left [crespy] {crispy, creepy} under the circumstances related and i had returned to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} five or six days after my departure [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} becoming more and more uncomfortable had written to [lecornier] {} [lecornier] {} had replied giving him my fresh address it therefore came about that one day about the beginning of the third month after receiving the clothes as i was lounging on our threshold the town clock struck one the diligence from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} drew up in the square and a [traveller] {traveler, traveler} got down from it who asked the conductor two or three questions took his bearings and came straight to me i guessed half the truth [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} was walking with his knees out like [duguesclin] {} and nobody but a soldier or a tailor could walk thus i was not mistaken the stranger came straight to me and introduced himself it was [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} it was necessary to play something like the scene between don [juan] {} and m [dimanche] {} this was all the more difficult as i had never read don [juan] {} however instinct made up for ignorance i gave [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} a most cordial reception i introduced him to my mother to whom fortunately i had said a few words about this my first debt i offered him refreshment and i asked him to sit down or if he preferred so to do to visit our estate under the circumstances [bamps'] {} choice was a foregone conclusion he preferred to visit our estate now what was this property of which the reader has already heard me speak but which he will assuredly have forgotten our estate was the house of m [harlay] {parlay} on which my mother had been paying a life annuity for something like forty years m [harlay] {parlay} had died during my stay with [maître] {} [lefèvre] {} but just as though he had made a wager he died on the anniversary of his birth triumphantly terminating his ninetieth year unfortunately his death had not been much advantage to us my mother had borrowed on house and garden almost as much as house and garden were worth so that we were neither richer nor poorer by this inheritance though as there were certain duties to pay i may venture to state we were poorer rather than richer but [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} knew none of these details i therefore offered as i have said to take him over our estate he accepted i [unchained] {} [pryamus] {} and we set off after going fifty yards [pyramus] {} left us to follow a butcher boy who went by with a piece of mutton on his shoulder i give this detail although at first glance it may appear very trivial for it was not without influence upon my future for what would have happened to me and to [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} if this butcher boy whose name was [valtat] {} had not passed by and if [pyramus] {} had not followed him we went on our way without thinking of [pyramus] {} man jostles up against great events every moment of his life without seeing them and without being conscious of them we soon arrived m [harlay's] {parlay's} house now our own was situated in the place [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [fontaine] {} perhaps a couple of hundred steps from the house we lived in i had taken the keys i opened the doors and we began by looking over the interior of the house it was not so clean as to inspire great confidence everything had grown old along with the worthy man who had just died in it and who had taken great care not to undertake a single repair in it for said he it will last as long as i shall it had lasted as long as he had true but all the same it was time he died if he had lingered on merely another year or two with the same intention in his head he would have out lasted the house the inside of our poor property then afforded the most melancholy sight of complete neglect and dilapidation the floors were broken through the wall papers torn off the bricks broken [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} shook his head and said in his half [alsacian] {} and half french dialect [ach] {ash, ace, act, ch, ah} my [vord] {cord, ford, lord, word, void} my [vord] {cord, ford, lord, word, void} it is in a [fery] {very, fury, fern, fry, fey} pad [stade] {shade, spade, stage, stake, stale} most surely would i have offered [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} the house in exchange for his bill if he would have taken it when the house had been surveyed i said to [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} now let us go and see the garden is [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [garten] {marten, garden, garter} in [zo] {do, go, ho, lo, mo} pad a [stade] {shade, spade, stage, stake, stale} as [de] {be, he, me, re, we} house he asked well it has been rather neglected but now it belongs to us it [vill] {bill, dill, fill, gill, hill} take much money to restore dis old tumbledown place [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} discreetly observed bah we shall find it i replied if it is not in our own pockets it will be in someone [else's] {ease's} [goot] {boot, coot, foot, hoot, loot} if you can [vind] {bind, find, hind, kind, mind} it [zo] {do, go, ho, lo, mo} much [de] {be, he, me, re, we} better we crossed the yard and entered the garden it was at the beginning of [april] {} we had had two or three lovely days days one knows so well on which the year like a faithful servant seems to fold up winter's white garment and unfold the green robe of spring now although the garden was as neglected as the house it was pursuing its work of life in opposition to the work of death going on in the house the house grew older year by year year by year the garden renewed its youth it looked as though the trees had powdered themselves for a forest ball apples and pears in white and peaches and almonds in pink you could not imagine anything younger fresher or more full of life than was this garden of death everything was waking up with nature as she herself woke up the birds had begun to sing and three or four butterflies deceived by the flowers and by the first rays of sunshine were flying about still somewhat benumbed poor [ephemera] {ephemeral} born in the morning but to die by night well i asked [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} what do you say to the garden oh [dat] {bat, cat, eat, fat, hat} is [fery] {very, fury, fern, fry, fey} [bretty]

right the situation was growing embarrassing had we opened my poor mother's banking account and scratched together every farthing we should certainly not have been able to find the forty francs demanded just at that moment the door opened is m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} in asked a hoarse raucous voice yes m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} is here i replied in a bad temper what do you want with him i don't want him who does then an [englishman] {} at m [cartier's] {carrier's} an [englishman] {} i repeated yes an [englishman] {} who is very anxious to see you that was my own state of mind too the

me i will come back we will settle up our account on my return be [qvick] {quick} back i must [depard] {depart} dis [efening] {evening} set your mind at rest about that i shall be back in an instant i took up my cap and followed the stable lad who had told my mother to her great surprise that he had orders not to go back without me [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} at whose house was the [englishman] {} who demanded to see me was an old friend of our family the proprietor of the [boule] {joule, bole} [d'or] {door} a hotel situated at the extreme east of the town on the road to [soissons] {} the [diligences] {diligence} stopped at his house there was therefore nothing surprising that the [englishman] {} who was asking for me should be staying there what did astonish me was that this [englishman] {} should want me when i appeared in the kitchen old [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} who was warming himself according to his usual habit in the chimney corner came up to me look sharp he said i believe i am going to pull off a good thing for you come now that would be very welcome i replied i was never in greater need of a lucky windfall well follow me and [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} walking in front of me led me to a little [parlour] {parlor} where [travellers] {travelers, travelers} dined just as we opened the door we heard a voice saying with a strong [english] {} accent take care mine host the dog does not know me and will run out never fear [milord] {} replied [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} i am bringing his master every innkeeper considers an [englishman] {} has the right to the title of [milord] {} so they use the title [unsparingly] {} true it usually pays them to do so ah come in sir said the [englishman] {} trying to rise by leaning both his elbows on the arms of his chair he could not succeed seeing this i hastened to say to him pray do not disturb yourself monsieur oh i will not disturb myself said the [englishman] {} falling back in his arm chair with a sigh the time he took in getting up and falling back in his chair with the rising and falling movement suggestive of an [omelette] {} [soufflée] {souffle} which has fallen flat was occupied by me in quickly glancing at him and his surroundings he was a man of between forty and forty five years of age of sandy complexion with his hair clipped short and his whiskers cut [en] {an, in, on, ea, ed} collier he wore a blue coat with metal buttons a chamois leather waistcoat breeches of [grey] {prey, gray, grew} [woollen] {woolen, woolen} material with gaiters to match after the fashion of grooms he was seated before the table where he had just dined the table bore the debris of a meal sufficient for six people he must have weighed from three hundred to three hundred and fifty pounds [pyramus] {} was seated on the parquetry floor looking very melancholy round [pyramus] {} were placed ten or twelve shiny plates licked clean with that thoroughness i knew he was capable of in the matter of dirty plates on the last plate however were some scraps still [unconsumed] {} these [unconsumed] {} scraps were the cause of [pyramus's] {} depressed spirits please come and speak to me monsieur said the [englishman] {} i drew near him [pyramus] {} [recognised] {recognized} me yawned to notify the fact stretched himself full length on his stomach so as to get as near to me as possible his paws stretched out on the floor his nose laid on his paws yes monsieur i said to the [englishman] {} now said he then after a pause he added that dog of yours has taken my fancy he is greatly [honoured] {honored} monsieur and they have told me you might perhaps agree to sell him to me if i were to pay you a good price for him i shall not need very much persuasion monsieur i have been trying to get rid of him and since he pleases you oh yes he pleases me well then take him oh i do not want to take the dog without paying for him [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} nudged my elbow monsieur i said i am not a dealer in dogs he was given to me i will give him to you well but he has cost you his keep oh the keep of a dog does not come to much never mind if is but fair i should pay for his food how long have you had him nearly two years then i owe you for his food for two years [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} continued to nudge my elbow and it occurred to me that the dog's keep would help admirably to pay for the master's clothes very well said i we will settle it so you shall pay me for his keep reckon it up what do you think of fifty francs per year oh oh is it too much i asked on the contrary i do not think it is enough the dog eats a lot yes true monsieur i was intending to warn you of that oh i have witnessed it but i like animals and people who eat a lot it shows they have a good digestion and a good digestion tends to good [humour] {humor} very well then you shall fix your own charge you said i think that it was to be ten [napoleons] {} no monsieur i said five [napoleons] {} [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} nudged my elbow harder and harder ah five [napoleons] {} you will not take ten no monsieur and only that because i happen at this moment to be in great need of five [napoleons] {} won't you take fifteen [napoleons] {} i am sure the dog is worth fifteen [napoleons] {} no no no no give me five [napoleons] {} and he is yours what do you call him [pyramus] {} [pyramus] {} exclaimed the [englishman] {} [pyramus] {} did not budge oh continued the [englishman] {} what did you say you called him i said [pyramus] {} he did not stir when i called him that is because he is not yet accustomed to your pronunciation oh he will soon get used to it there is no doubt of it you think so i am sure of it good i thank you monsieur here are the five [napoleons] {} i hesitated to take them but in the [english] {} accent with which he pronounced the last words there was an intonation which so cruelly reminded me of the [german] {merman, germane} accent of [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} that i decided i am much obliged to you monsieur i said on the contrary it is i who ought to thank you the [englishman] {} replied trying to raise himself afresh an attempt which was as abortive as the first i made him a sign with my hand as i bowed he sank back into his arm chair and i went out well now how did it come about that [pyramus] {} fell into the hands of such a master i asked old [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} that scamp of a dog was born with a lucky spoon in his mouth it was the simplest thing in the world [valtat] {} brought me a piece of lamb [pyramus] {} scented the fresh meat he followed [valtat] {} [valtat] {} came here [pyramus] {} came here the [englishman] {} got out of the carriage he saw your dog he had been recommended to take shooting exercise he asked me if the dog was a good one i told him it was he asked me who owned the dog i told him it belonged to you he asked me if you would consent to sell it i told him i would send and fetch you and then he could ask you himself i sent for you you came there's the whole story [pyramus] {} is sold and you are not ill pleased why certainly not the rascal is such a thief that i should have been obliged to give him away or to break his neck he was ruining us [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that would not be a difficult task then passing to another train of ideas he said so you have returned home that is so you were sick of [crespy] {crispy, creepy} i am sick of every place what do you want to do now why i want to go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and when do you start may be sooner than you think do not go without giving me an opportunity to pay you out never fear before i went to [crespy] {crispy, creepy} i had thoroughly beaten [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} at billiards besides i went on if i go as i shall not leave in any carriage but one of yours you can stop me on the step done but this time it must be a struggle to death to death your five [napoleons] {} must be staked you know i never play for money and as for my five [napoleons] {} they already have their vocation well well well adieu [au] {cu, mu, nu, ad, ah} [revoir] {} and i left [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} with this engagement booked we shall see where it led me when i re entered the house i found [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} who was beginning to grow impatient the first coach for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} passed through [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} at eight o'clock in the evening it was now seven ah [goot] {boot, coot, foot, hoot, loot} he said there you are i did not [regon] {region} i should [zee] {bee, fee, gee, lee, nee} you again what i said imitating his jargon you did not [regon] {region} you should [zee] {bee, fee, gee, lee, nee} me again wondrous power of money i was mocking [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} who an hour before had made me tremble with fear [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} knit his eyebrows we [zay] {bay, day, gay, hay, jay} den he said we say that i owe you twenty francs per month that two months have gone by without payment and that consequently i owe you forty francs you owe me [vorty] {forty} [vrancs] {francs} all right my dear [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} here you are and i threw two [napoleons] {} on the table taking care to let the three others in the palm of my hand be visible my poor mother looked at me with the most profound amazement i reassured her with a sign the sign allayed her fears but not her surprise [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} examined the two [napoleons] {} rubbed them to make sure they were not false and rolled them one after the other into his pocket you do not [vant] {cant, pant, rant, want, vent} any more dings he asked no thank you my dear monsieur besides i am expecting to leave here for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} in a short time you will bear in mind that i have the first claim on your custom all right my dear [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} for good and all but if you mean to start at eight o'clock if i mean to [stard] {shard, sward, staid, stand, stare} i should just [tink] {fink, kink, link, mink, oink} so well then there is no time to lose the [tevil] {devil, evil} you know where the coach stops [yess] {less, mess, yeas, yens, yeps} very well [bon] {con, don, eon, ion, non} voyage [atieu] {adieu} [monsir] {} [toumas] {} [atieu] {adieu} [matame] {madame} [toumas] {} [atieu] {adieu} [atieu] {adieu} and [bamps] {camps, damps, lamps, ramps, tamps} delighted not only at having secured forty francs but still further at being somewhat reassured about the rest of his account set off wafting us his parting benedictions with all the speed his little legs could make my mother just waited till she had closed both doors then she said but where did you get that money you young rogue i sold [pyramus] {} mother for how much a hundred francs so that there are sixty francs left at your service dear mother i am afraid i must take them i have two hundred francs to pay to morrow to the [warehouseman] {} and i only have a hundred and fifty towards it here they are but on one condition what is it that you let me have them back again as soon as i set off for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} with whom are you going that must be my business well so be it i really begin to feel as though god were with you at this we both went to bed with that settled faith that has never deserted me and i doubt even whether my mother's faith at any rate at that moment was as strong as mine chapter [iii] {} my mother is obliged to sell her land and her house the residue the [piranèses] {} an architect at twelve hundred francs salary i discount my first bill [gondon] {} how i was nearly killed at his house the fifty francs [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} the game of billiards how six hundred small glasses of absinthe [equalled] {squalled, equaled, equaled} twelve journeys to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} the time had now come when my poor mother was obliged to take a definite step she had borrowed so much and so often upon our thirty or forty acres let to m [gilbert] {filbert} of [soucy] {saucy, soupy} and upon the house which m [harlay] {parlay} had at last left for us that the value of both acres and house was nearly absorbed by mortgages so it was decided to sell everything the land was sold by auction and fetched thirty three thousand francs the house was sold by private contract for twelve thousand francs to the m [picot] {pilot, pivot} who had given me my first lessons in fencing we [realised] {realized} forty five thousand francs when our debts were settled and all expenses paid my mother had two hundred and fifty three francs left lest some optimistic readers should think that this was our annual income i hasten to say that it was capital need anyone ask if my poor mother was distressed at such a result we had never really been so close to destitution my mother fell into the depths of discouragement since my father's death we had been unceasingly drawing nearer and nearer to the end of all our resources it had been a long struggle from 1806 to 1823 it had lasted for seventeen years but we were beaten at last nevertheless i never felt gayer or more confident i do not know why i deserve it whether for deeds done in this world or in other worlds where i may have had previous existences but god seems to have me under his special care and however grave my situation he comes openly to my [succour] {succor} so my god i proudly and yet very humbly confess thy name before believers and before infidels and not even from the merit of faith do i say this but simply because it is the truth for [hadst] {} thou appeared to me when i invoked thee o my god and [hadst] {} thou asked me child say boldly what it is you want i should never have dared to ask for half the [favours] {favors} thou [hast] {bast, cast, east, fast, last} granted me out of thy infinite bounty well my mother told me that when all our debts were paid we only had two hundred and fifty three francs left very well i said to my mother you must give me the fifty three francs i will set out for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and this time i promise to return only with good news are you aware my dear boy said my mother that you are asking me for a fifth of our capital you remember that you owe me sixty francs yes but recollect that when i said 'for what purpose shall i return you the sixty francs ' you replied 'that is my business ' very well so indeed it is my business will you give me the [piranèses] {} which are upstairs in the big portfolio what do you call the [piranèses] {} those large black engravings that my father brought back from [italy] {} what will you do with them i will find a home for them my mother shrugged her shoulders dubiously do as you like about them she said there was an architect named [oudet] {} [amongst] {} the staff at the workhouse who very much wanted our [piranèses] {} i had always refused him them telling him that one day i would bring him them myself the day had come but it was an unlucky day [oudet] {} had no money this was quite conceivable [oudet] {} as architect to the castle received only a hundred francs per month true i was not very exorbitant in the matter of my [piranèses] {} which were well worth five or six hundred francs i only asked fifty francs [oudet] {} offered to pay me these fifty francs in three [months'] {months} time in three months how could i wait for three months i left [oudet] {} in despair i ought to say in justice to [oudet] {} that he was probably in even lower straits than i was in leaving [oudet] {} i ran up against another of my friends whose name was [gondon] {} he was a shooting comrade he had a property three leagues from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} at [cuvre] {} the country of the beautiful [gabrielle] {} and we had very often spent whole weeks together there shooting by day and poaching by night it was at his place that i nearly lost my life one evening in the most ridiculous fashion imaginable it was the evening before the opening of the shooting season five or six of us shooters had come from [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and we were putting up at [gondon's] {} in order to be up early for a start at daybreak now as we had neither rooms nor beds enough for everybody the sitting room had been transformed into a dormitory in the four corners of which four beds were set up that is to say four mattresses were laid down when the candles were extinguished my three companions took it into their heads to start a bolster fight as for some reason or another i did not feel inclined for the sport i announced my intention of remaining neutral the result of this compact was that after a quarter of an hour's fight between [austrians] {} [russians] {} and [prussians] {} the [austrians] {} [russians] {} and [prussians] {} became allies and united to fall upon me who represented [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} so they hurled themselves on my bed and began to [belabour] {belabor} me with the [afore] {adore, afire, fore} mentioned bolsters as threshers beat out corn with their flails in a barn i drew up my sheet over my head and waited patiently till the storm should have passed over which could not be long first at the rate they were beating and as i anticipated the storm calmed down one thrasher retired then another but the third who was my cousin [félix] {} [deviolaine] {} upheld no doubt by the tie of kinship continued striking in spite of the retreat of the others suddenly he stopped and i heard him get silently into his bed one might have thought some accident had overtaken him which he was anxious to conceal from his comrades in fact the opposite end of the bolster to that which he had held in his hands had burst by the violence of the blows and all the feathers had escaped this down made a mountain just where the sheet which protected my head joined the bolster i was totally unaware of the fact as i did not feel any more blows and having heard my last enemy retire to his bed i gently put out my head and as for the past ten minutes i had become more or less stifled according as i tightened or loosened the sheet i drew a full breath i swallowed a big armful of feathers suffocation was instantaneous almost complete i uttered an inarticulate cry and feeling myself literally being strangled i began to roll about the room my companions at first thought i had now taken it into my head to pirouette like a ballet dancer just as they had fancied a fight but they [realised] {realized} at last that the strangled sounds i gave forth expressed acute agony [gondon] {} was the first to [realise] {realize, realism, realist} that something very serious had happened to me from some unknown cause and that i was in [extremis] {extremes, extremism, extremist} [félix] {} who alone could have explained my gyrations and my [wheezings] {wheezing} lay still and pretended to be asleep [gondon] {} rushed into the kitchen returned with a candle and threw light on the scene i must have been a very funny spectacle and i confess there was a general burst of laughter but though i had been pretty gluttonous i had not swallowed all the feathers and all the down some stuck to my curly head giving me a false air of resemblance to [polichinelle] {} this false air soon began to look like reality from the flush of redness that strangulation had sent into my face they thought water was the best thing to give me one of my companions named [labarre] {} ran in his shirt to the pump and filled a pot with water which he laughingly brought me such hilarity when my torture had reached its height drove me wild i seized the pot by the handle and chucked the contents down [labarre's] {} back the water was icy cold its temperature was little in harmony with the natural warmth of his blood and it produced such gambols and such contortions on the part of the anointed that in spite of my various woes the desire to laugh was now on my side i made a different effort from any i had tried hitherto and i expectorated some of the feathers and down which had blocked my throat from that moment i was safe nevertheless i continued to spit feathers for a week and i coughed for a month i beg my reader's pardon for this digression but as i had neglected to put down this important episode in my life in its chronological order it will not be deemed extraordinary if i seize the first opportunity that presents itself to repair this omission well i met [gondon] {} coming out of [oudet's] {} house he had a hundred francs in his hand oh my dear fellow i said if you are so wealthy you can surely lend [oudet] {} fifty francs what to do to buy my [piranèses] {} from me your [piranèses] {} yes i want to go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} [oudet] {} offered to buy my [piranèses] {} for fifty francs and now and now he does not wish to have them on the contrary he is dying to possess them but he hasn't a son and cannot pay me for three months and you want fifty francs indeed i do you would like to have them rather wait perhaps we can arrange matters oh do try my good fellow there is a very simple way i cannot give you the fifty francs because i have promised my tailor a hundred francs to day but [oudet] {} can make a [cheque] {} out to me for fifty francs at three months i will endorse the [cheque] {} and i will give it to the tailor as ready money we went to [oudet's] {} [oudet] {} made out the [cheque] {} and i carried off the money thanking [gondon] {} and above all god who out of his infinite loving kindness had provided me the means to advance a step farther on my way i accompanied [gondon] {} as far as his tailor's at the tailor's door i ran up against old [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} well my boy he said isn't there a bit left of your dog's money to pay for a small glass of wine for your old friend certainly if he wins it of me at billiards and i jingled my fifty francs i turned to [gondon] {} come and see what happens i said to him you go on i will rejoin you at [camberlin's] {} is it not at [camberlin's] {} [camberlin] {} was the traditional coffee house since the discovery of coffee and the invention of billiards the [camberlins] {} had sold coffee and kept a [billiard] {billiards} table from father to son it was to [camberlin's] {} my grandfather used to go every evening to take a hand at dominoes or [piquet] {piqued, piques, pique} until his little bitch [charmante] {} came scratching at the door with two lanterns held in her jaws it was at [camberlin's] {} my father and m [deviolaine] {} came to challenge each [other's] {ether's, ocher's, otter's, others, bother's} skill at play as on another green carpet they challenged each [other's] {ether's, ocher's, otter's, others, bother's} skill at the chase it was at [camberlin's] {} finally that thanks to my antecedents i had been able almost gratis when i lost to begin my education as an elder [philibert] {} under three different masters who had ended by seeing me a better player than they were these three masters were [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} against whom i was going to wipe out an old score [camusat] {} [hiraux's] {} nephew who [reclothed] {} his uncle at la [râpée] {} when they turned him out of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} in drawers and shirt and a delightful youth called [gaillard] {} who was a first class player in all sorts of games and who had to my great satisfaction replaced m [miaud] {} my old rival at the work house so i had become a much better player than [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} but as he would never admit it he invariably declined the six points i as invariably offered him before we began the match just as we were trying our cues on the [billiard] {billiards} table [gondon] {} entered what will you take [gondon] {} [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} asked [dumas] {pumas, dumps} is paying i will take absinthe i want to enjoy my dinner well to day well so will i said [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} and you i you know i have made a vow never to take either liqueur or coffee to what saint and on what occasion i made this vow i cannot at all say but i know i kept it religiously then we will say two small [absinthes] {absinthe} replied [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} continuing to joke that will be six [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} waiter in exchange for your receipt in the provinces at any rate at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} a small glass of absinthe costs three [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} my dear [gondon] {} i said i cannot offer you a better prayer than my uncle's the [curé] {curb, curd, cure, curl, curs} at [béthisy] {} 'my god side neither with one nor with the other and you will see a rascal receive a jolly good whacking ' will you have your six points father [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} go along with you [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} exclaimed disdainfully putting my ball on the yellow we played [russian] {} fashion a game with five balls and thirty six points i made the yellow six times three times into the right pocket and three times into the left six times six thirty six first round your two small glasses are not worth more than their three [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} father [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} four [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} you mean to say not unless i let you win the second round come on then will you have the six points i will give them to you if you like done mark my six points [gondon] {} i have my designs on father [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} i mean him to contribute to my visit to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} the [diligences] {diligence} start from his hotel at the second round [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} got up to twelve at thirty points i had a run and made sixteen more that made forty six points instead of thirty six deducting the six points restored to [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} there still remained four i could offer him in return he refused them with his usual dignity but [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} was beside himself when he had lost the first game and the wilder he was the more obstinate he became once set going he would have played away his land his hotel his saucepans to the very chickens that were turning on his spit worthy old [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} he is alive yet although he is eighty six or eighty seven he is still remarkably hale and lives with his two children i never go to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} without calling on him last time i saw him about a year ago i paid him a compliment on his health my goodness my dear [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} i said to him you are like our oak trees which if they do not grow very tall go deep into the soil and gain in roots what they miss in the way of leaves you will live to the last judgment oh my boy he said i have been very ill did you not know it no when three and a half years ago what was the matter with you i had toothache that was your own fault what business have you [with'] {with} teeth at your age well on that day poor old [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} (i am referring to the day of our [game)] {gamed, gamer, games, game} on that day to use a gaming term i took a fine tooth out of his head we played for five hours on end always doubling i won six hundred small glasses of absinthe from him we should have played longer and you may judge what an ocean of absinthe [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} would have owed me if [auguste] {august, auguster} had not come to look for him [auguste] {august, auguster} was one of [cartier's] {carrier's} sons his father stood in great awe of him he put his finger to his lips to ask me to keep mum i was as generous as was [alexander] {} in the matter of the family of [porus] {torus, pores, ports, porous} i let [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} go without demanding my winnings from him and [gondon] {} and i reckoned up the account reduced to money the six hundred small glasses of absinthe would have produced a total of eighteen hundred [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} that is to say ninety francs i could have paid the journey to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} a dozen times over my mother had good cause to say my boy god is on your side my mother was very uneasy when i returned home she knew what folly i was capable of when i had got an idea into my head and it was therefore with some anxiety that she asked me where i had been generally when i had been to [camberlin's] {} i took a roundabout way in telling her of it my poor mother foreseeing what passions would one day surge in me was afraid that gaming might be one of them in several of her surmises she was correct but at any rate she was completely mistaken in this one so i told her what had just happened how the [piranèses] {} had brought us in fifty francs and how m [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} was going to pay my fare to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} but these blessings from heaven brought sadness with them for they meant our separation i did my best to comfort her by telling her that the separation would be only for a little while and that as soon as i had obtained a berth at fifteen hundred francs she should leave [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} also and come and join me but my mother knew that a berth at fifteen hundred francs was an [eldorado] {} difficult to discover chapter [iv] {id, if, in, is, it} how i obtain a recommendation to general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} m [danré] {} of [vouty] {gouty} advises my mother to let me go to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} my good byes [laffitte] {} and [perregaux] {} the three things which [maître] {} [mennesson] {} asks me not to forget the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} [grégoire's] {} advice and the discussion with him i leave [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} one morning i said to my mother have you anything to say to m [danré] {} i am going to [vouty] {gouty} what do you want of m [danré] {} to ask him for a letter to general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} my mother raised her eyes to heaven she questioned whence came all these ideas to me that converged all to one end m [danré] {} was my father's old friend who having had his left hand mutilated when out shooting had been brought into our house there the reader will remember doctor [lécosse] {} had [skilfully] {skillfully, skillfully} amputated his thumb and as my mother had nursed him with the greatest care through the whole of the illness the accident brought on he had a warm feeling in his heart towards my mother my sister and myself it always therefore gave him great pleasure to see me whether i arrived with a message from me [mennesson] {} his lawyer when i was with me [mennesson] {} or whether on my own account this time it was on my own affairs i told him the object of my visit when general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} was put on the lists for election the electors would not appoint him but m [danré] {} had supported his [candidature] {} and thanks to m [danré's] {} influence in the department general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} had been elected we know what a foremost place the illustrious patriot took in the chamber general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} was not an eloquent orator he was far better than that he possessed a warm heart ready to act at the inspiration of every noble passion not a single great question came under his notice during all the time he was in the chamber that was not supported by him if it was a worthy object or that was not opposed by him if it was unworthy his words fell from the tribune terrible as the return thrusts in a duel piercing thrusts nearly always deadly to his adversaries but like all men of feeling he wore himself out in the struggle the most constant and most maddening struggle of all it killed him while rendering his name immortal in 1823 general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} was at the height of his popularity and from the pinnacle to which he had attained he reminded m [danré] {} from time to time of his existence which proved to the humble farmer who like [philoctètes] {} had made sovereigns but had no desire to be one that he was still his affectionate and grateful friend therefore m [danré] {} did not feel in any way averse to give me the letter i asked of him and it was couched in the most [favourable] {favorable} terms then when m [danré] {} had written signed and sealed the letter he asked me about my pecuniary resources i told him everything even to the ingenious methods by the aid of which i had obtained what i had upon my word he exclaimed i had half a mind to offer you my purse but really it would smirch your record people do not do that sort of thing to end in failure you should succeed with that fifty francs of yours and i do not wish to take away the credit of owing it entirely to yourself take courage then and go in peace if you are absolutely in need of my services write to me from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} so you feel hopeful i said to m [danré] {} very are you coming to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} on [thursday] {} [thursday] {} was market day yes why do you ask because if you are i would beg you to call and tell my mother you are hopeful she has great confidence in you and as everybody seems bent on telling her i shall never do anything the fact is you have not done very much up to now because they were determined to push me into a vocation i was not fitted for dear monsieur [danré] {} but you will see directly they leave me alone to do what i am cut out for i shall become a hard worker mind you do i will reassure your mother relying on your word you may and i will [fulfil] {fulfill, fulfill} it the day but one after my visit m [danré] {} came to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} as he had promised and saw my mother i was watching for his coming i let him start the conversation and then i came in my mother was crying but seemed to have made up her mind when she saw me she held out her hand you are bent on leaving me then she said i must mother but do not be uneasy if we separate this time it will not be for long yes because you will fail and return to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} once more no no mother on the contrary because i shall succeed and bring you to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and when do you mean to go listen mother dear when a great resolution is taken the sooner it is put into execution the better ask m [danré] {} yes ask [lazarille] {} i do not know what you did to m [danré] {} but the fact is m [danré] {} is fair minded mother he knows that everything must move in its own appointed surroundings if it is to become of any worth i should make a bad lawyer a bad solicitor a bad sheriffs officer i should make a shocking bad teacher i you know quite well that it took three schoolmasters to get me through the multiplication table and it was not a brilliant success very well i believe i can do something better what you scamp mother i swear i know nothing about what i shall do but you remember what the fortune teller whom you questioned on my behalf predicted my mother sighed what did she predict asked m [danré] {} she said i replied 'i cannot tell you what your son will become madame i can only see him through clouds and flashes of lightning like a [traveller] {traveler, traveler} who is crossing high mountains reaching a height to which few men attain i do not say he will command people but i foresee he will speak to them although i cannot indicate the precise lines of his destiny your son belongs to that class of men whom we style rulers ' 'my son is to become a king then ' my mother laughingly retorted 'no no but something similar something perhaps more desirable every king has not a crown on his head and a [sceptre] {} in his hand ' 'so much the better ' said my mother 'i never envied the lot of madame [bonaparte] {} ' i was five years old monsieur [danré] {} i was present when my horoscope was made well i will prove the [gipsy] {tipsy, gypsy} to be in the right you know that prophecies are not always fulfilled because they must be fulfilled but because they put a fixed idea into the minds of those about whom they are made which influences events which modifies circumstances which finally brings them to the end aimed at because this end was revealed to them in advance whilst had it not been for the revelation they would have passed by the end without noticing it i should like to know where he got all these notions from my mother exclaimed oh why from his own thoughts said m [danré] {} then is it your judgment too that he ought to go i advise it but you know the poor lad's resources fifty francs and his carriage fare paid well that will be enough if he is to succeed or if his destiny urges him on as he says if he had a million he would not obtain what he wishes to obtain so long as he had no vocation for it well well he had better go if he is so set on it when shall i go mother when you like only you must let us have a day together first listen mother mine i will stay all to day to morrow and [saturday] {} with you on [saturday] {} night i will leave by the ten o'clock coach i shall reach [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} by five i shall have time to get to [adolphe's] {} house before he goes out ah said my mother as she heaved a sigh he is the one who has led you astray i did not much heed the sigh because i felt sure the engagement made would be fulfilled i began to make my round of farewells i had not seen [adèle] {addle} since her marriage i would not write to her the letter might be opened by her husband and compromise her i applied to [louise] {louse} [brézette] {} our friend in common alas i found the poor child in tears [chollet] {} whose education in forestry was finished had been obliged to return to his parents and he had carried off with him all the young girl's first dreams of love she was forlorn and inconsolable she mourned the whole of her life for her lover and bore the marks of her love sickness i quoted the example of [ariadne] {} to her advising her to follow it and i believe i believe she followed it and that i contributed in some measure towards inducing her to follow it poor beloved children true and affectionate friends of my youth my life is now so much taken up the hours that belong to me are so few i am common property to such an extent that when by chance i go home or you come here i cannot give you all the time that the claims of love and of memory demand but when i shall have won a few of those hours of repose in search of which [théaulon] {} spent his life and which he never found oh i promise you those hours shall be given to you unquestionably [unshared] {} by others you have ample claims to demand the leisure of my old age and you will make my latter days to flourish as in my springtime for there are closed tombs there which draw me as much more even than open houses dead friends who talk to me more clearly than do the living when i left [louise] {louse} i went to [maître] {} [mennesson] {} i had always kept on pretty good terms with him but since our separation he had married i think his marriage made him more [sceptical] {skeptical} than ever ah he said when he caught sight of me so there you are yes i have come to bid you good bye you have decided to go then on [saturday] {} night and how much do you take with you fifty francs my dear lad there are people who started on less than that m [laffitte] {} for example yes exactly so i mean to pay him a call and to ask him for a post in his office well then if you find a pin on his carpet do not fail to pick it up and to put it on his mantelpiece why because when m [laffitte] {} arrived in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} much poorer even than you he went to see m [perregaux] {} just as you are going to call on m [laffitte] {} he went to ask for a place in his office as you are going to ask for one in his m [perregaux] {} had no vacancy he dismissed m [laffitte] {} who was going away his eyes looking down sadly on the floor as father [aubry's] {} were inclined towards the grave when he perceived a pin not on the earth but on the carpet m [laffitte] {} was a tidy man he picked up the pin and put it on the mantelpiece saying 'pardon me monsieur ' but m [perregaux] {} be it known was a person who noticed every little thing he reflected that a young man who would pick up a pin from the ground must be an orderly person and as m [laffitte] {} was going away he said to him 'i have been thinking monsieur stay ' 'but you told me you had no opening in your office ' 'if there is not one we will make one for you ' m [perregaux] {} did as a matter of fact make room for him as his partner that is a very delightful story dear monsieur [mennesson] {} and i thank you for your great kindness in relating it to me but i am afraid it is no good to me for unluckily i am no picker up of pins ah that is precisely your great fault or my strongest point we shall see therefore if you have any good advice to give me beware of priests hate the [bourbons] {bourbon} and remember that the only state worthy of a great nation is a republic my dear monsieur [mennesson] {} reversing the order of your advice i would say yes i am of your opinion as to the government which is most suited to a great nation and on the supposition that if i am anything i am a republican like yourself as for the [bourbons] {bourbon} i neither love them nor hate them i have heard it said that their race produced a holy king a good one and a great one saint [louis] {louts} [henri] {} [iv] {id, if, in, is, it} and [louis] {louts} [xiv] {} only the last reigning sovereign returned to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} riding behind a [cossack] {} that i believe damaged the bourbon cause in the eyes of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} so it comes about that if some day my voice is needed to hasten their going away and my gun to assist their departure those who are driving them out will find one voice and one gun the more as to distrusting priests i have only known but one the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} [grégoire] {} and as he seemed to me the model of all [christian] {} virtues until i encounter a bad one let me believe that all are good well well you will change all that it is possible meanwhile give me your hand i am going to ask for his blessing go then and much good may it do you i believe it will i went to the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} well well he said so you are going to leave us it will be seen that the [rumour] {rumor} of my departure had already spread all over the place yes m [l'abbé] {} and i have come to ask you to remember me in your prayers oh my prayers i thought that was the thing you cared least about m [l'abbé] {} do you remember the day i made my first communion yes i know it produced a profound impression on you but you let it stay at that and you have never been seen at church since do you suppose the sacrament would have the same effect on me at the tenth time as on the first ah my god no certainly not unhappily one gets accustomed to everything in this world very well m [l'abbé] {} my other impressions would have effaced that one must not get too used to sacred things m [l'abbé] {} frequent use of them not only takes away their grandeur but still more their efficacy who told you once that i should only need the consolation of the church in great trouble as one only requires bleeding in serious illness you have a curious way of putting things well m [l'abbé] {} you said it yourself more than once we must treat men less according to their maladies than according to their temperaments i am [impressionability] {} personified i have an impulsive character you yourself told me so i shall commit all kinds of mistakes all kinds of follies never a wicked or disgraceful action not indeed because i am better than anyone else but because bad and [dishonourable] {dishonorable} actions are the result of reflection and of calculation and when i act it is on the spur of the moment and this impulse is so quick that the action springing from it is done before i have had time to consider the consequences or to calculate the results there is some truth in what you say but come what is the use of giving any advice to a character of your [calibre] {} well i did not come to ask for your advice dear [abbé] {abbe, abbr} i came to beg your prayers prayers you do not believe in them ah pardon that is another matter no true i have not always had faith in them but do not be troubled on the day when i shall have need to believe in them i shall believe in them listen when i took my communion had i not read in [voltaire] {} that it was a curious sort of god that needed to be digested and in [pigault] {} [lebrun] {} that the host was nothing more than a wafer double the thickness of an ordinary wafer well did that prevent me feeling a trembling that shook my whole body when the host touched my lips did it prevent the tears springing into my eyes tears of humility tears of thankfulness above all tears of love towards god do you not believe that god prefers a generous heart which abandons itself utterly to him when it is too full to a niggardly heart which only yields itself drop by drop should not prayer come from the depths of the soul rather than consist of the words of one's lips do you believe god will be angry if i forget him during ordinary daily life as one forgets the beating of one's heart so long as i return to him at every time of trouble or of joy no m [l'abbé] {} no on the contrary i believe god loves me and that is why i forget him just as one forgets a good father whom one is always sure of well replied the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} it matters little to me if you forget god but i do not want you to doubt his existence oh be at rest on that point it is not the hunter who ever doubts the existence of god no man does who has spent whole nights in the moonlit woods who has studied nature from the elephant down to the mite who has watched the setting and the rising of the sun who has heard the songs of the birds their evening laments and their morning hymns of praise then all will be well now you know there is a text in the gospels which is short and easy to remember make it the foundation of your actions and you need not fear failure this text which ought to be engraved in letters of gold over the entry to every town over the entry to every house over the entry to every heart is ' do not do unto others that ye would not have them do to you ' and when philosophers [cavillers] {} libertines say to you 'confucius has a maxim better than that as follows do unto others what you would have them do to you ' reply 'no it is not better for it is false in its application one cannot always do what one would like others to do to oneself whilst one can always abstain from doing what one would not like them to do to oneself ' come kiss me and let us leave matters here we could not say anything better than that and with these words we embraced warmly and i left him the next day but one after having made my last visit to the cemetery a pious pilgrimage which my mother made almost every day and in which this time i accompanied her we wended our way towards the [hôtel] {hotel} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [boule] {joule, bole} [d'or] {door} where the passing coach was to pick me up and take me away to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} at half past nine we heard the sound of the wheels my mother and i had still another half hour together we retired into a room where we were alone and we wept together but our tears were from different causes my mother wept in doubt i wept in hope we could neither of us see the hand of god but very certainly god was present and his grace was with us chapter v i find [adolphe] {} again the pastoral drama first steps the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [bellune] {} general [sébastiani] {} his secretaries and his snuff boxes the fourth floor small door to the left the general who painted battles i got down at no 9 rue [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [bouloy] {} at five in the morning this time i did not make the same mistake that i did when i left the [théâtre] {} [français] {} i took my bearings and by certain landmarks i thought i [recognised] {recognized} the vicinity of the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} i questioned the conductor who confirmed my convictions and handed me my small luggage i disputed over it victoriously with several porters and i reached the [hôtel] {hotel} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} towards half past five there i felt at home the waiter [recognised] {recognized} me as the [traveller] {traveler, traveler} with the hares and the partridges and in the absence of the landlord who was still asleep he took me to the room i had occupied on my last visit my first desire was for sleep owing to the emotions of parting and owing to wakeful dreams i had had in the diligence i arrived tired out i told the boy to wake me at nine if i had not given any signs of life before i knew [adolphe's] {} habits by now and i knew i need not hurry over going to his house but when the landlord himself came into my room at nine o'clock he found me up sleep would have none of me it was [sunday] {sundry, sundae} morning under the [bourbons] {bourbon} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} was very dreary on [sundays] {sundaes} strict orders forbade the opening of shops and it was considered not only a breach of religious order but still worse a crime of [lèse] {lose} majesty to disobey these ordinances i risked being arrested in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} at nine in the morning nearly as much as i had risked it by being in the streets after midnight i did not feel uneasy thanks to my sportsman's instincts i found the rue [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [mont] {cont, font, wont, mint, moat} [blanc] {bland, blank, blanch} then the rue [pigale] {} then finally no 14 in

have come to try my fortune for the last time this time i must stop in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} whatever happens well as to that you will always be welcome here my dear boy we have a

why i wanted to know what the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [bellune] {} was as ministers are but mortals and quickly forgotten when they are dead it gives me pleasure to

me, re, we} [bellune] {} no matter what office he held i had a letter of his in my possession wherein he had thanked my father for a service he had rendered in [italy] {} he placed himself at my father's disposition in case he should ever be able to do anything for him the occasion offered on behalf of the son instead of the father but as at that period the law of inheritance had not yet been abolished as there was not even talk of abolishing it i did not doubt that as i had succeeded in the direct line to [napoleon's] {} hatred i should succeed in direct line also to the gratitude of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [bellune] {} i begged a pen and ink from [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} i trimmed the quill with the care the case demanded and in my very best handwriting i drew up a petition asking for an interview with the minister of war i [particularised] {particularized} all my claims to his [favour] {favor} i [emphasised] {emphasized} them in the name of my father which the marshal could not have forgotten i recalled the old friendship which had united them while leaving [unmentioned] {} the service my father had rendered him of which the marshal's letter (he was then a major or a [colonel)] {colonels, colonel} gave proof then easy about my future i returned to literature [adolphe] {} sensibly pointed out to me that sure though i felt of the protection of marshal victor it might still be as well to throw out my line in other directions in the unlikely but still possible case of my being deceived i told [adolphe] {} that if marshal victor failed me there still remained marshal [jourdan] {} and marshal [sébastiani] {} it was quite out of the question that these would not move heaven and earth for me i had three or four letters from [jourdan] {} to my father which gave token of a friendship equal to that of [damon] {demon, damn, daemon, damson} and [pythias] {} i had only one letter from marshal [sébastiani] {} but this letter proved that when at loggerheads with [bonaparte] {} during the [egyptian] {} campaign it was through the intercession of my father who was then on excellent terms with the general in chief that he had obtained a commission in the expedition surely such services as these would never be forgotten at that time as can be seen i was very simple very provincial very confiding i am wrong in saying at that time alas i am just the same now perhaps more so nevertheless [adolphe's] {} suspicions disturbed me i decided not to wait for the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [bellune's] {} answer before seeing my other patrons and i told [adolphe] {} i meant to buy the [almanach] {almanacs, almanac} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} 25 000 [adresses] {dresses, addresses, addresses} in order to find out where they lived do not put yourself to that expense said [adolphe] {} i believe my father has it i will lend it you the tone in which [adolphe] {} said do not put yourself to that expense annoyed me it was as clear as day that he believed i should be making a useless expenditure in buying the directory in question i was angry with [adolphe] {} for having such a low opinion of men to give him the lie i went next morning to marshal [jourdan] {} i announced myself as [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} my success was surprising the marshal no doubt imagined that the news he had received fifteen years ago was not true and that my father was still alive but when he saw me his face changed completely he remembered perfectly that a general [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} had existed in times gone by with whom he had come in contact but he had never heard of the existence of a son in spite of all i could urge to establish my identity he dismissed me after ten [minutes'] {minutest, minutes} interview still a [disbeliever] {disbelieved, disbelieves, disbelieve} in my existence this good marshal was stronger than [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [thomas] {} he saw and did not believe it was a sad beginning i recalled the way in which advising me not to buy an [almanach] {almanacs, almanac} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} 25 000 [adresses] {dresses, addresses, addresses} [adolphe] {} had said to me do not put yourself to that expense was it possible perchance that [adolphe's] {} [scepticism] {skepticism} might prove correct these depressing [cogitations] {cogitation} passed through my mind while i was walking from the [faubourg] {} saint [germain] {} to the [faubourg] {} saint [honoré] {honors, honor} that is to say from marshal [jourdan's] {} to marshal [sébastiani's] {} i announced myself as i had at marshal [jourdan's] {} at my name the door opened i thought for a moment that i had inherited [ali] {alb, ale, all} [baba's] {babe's, baby's, baa's} famous open sesame the general was in his study i [italicise] {italicize} general as i was in error previously in calling the famous minister of foreign affairs to [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} marshal [comte] {cote, come} [sébastiani] {} was only a general when i paid my visit to him so the general was in his study in the four comers of this study as at the four corners of a map are the four cardinal points or four winds were four secretaries these four secretaries were writing at his dictation they were three less in number than [cæsar's] {} but two more than [napoleon's] {} each of these secretaries had on his desk besides his pen his paper and his penknife a gold snuff box which he opened and offered to the general every time the latter had occasion when walking round the room to stop in front of the desk the general would daintily insert the first finger and thumb of a hand whose whiteness and delicacy had been the envy of his grand cousin [napoleon] {} take a voluptuous sniff of the [spanish] {} powder and like [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [malade] {malady} [imaginaire] {} proceed to measure the length and the breadth of the room my visit was short whatever consideration i might have for the general i did not feel inclined to become his snuff box boy i returned to my hotel in the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} somewhat cast down the first two men i had turned to had blown upon my golden dreams and tarnished them besides although a whole day had gone by although i had given my address as accurately as possible i had not yet received any answer from the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [bellune] {} i picked up my [almanack] {almanacs, almanac} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} 25 000 [adresses] {dresses, addresses, addresses} and began to congratulate myself on not having wasted five francs in its acquisition i was quickly disillusioned as will be seen my cheerful confidence had gone i felt that sinking of heart which ever increases in proportion as golden dreams give place to reality i then turned over the leaves of the book purely and simply at [hap] {cap, gap, lap, map, nap} hazard looking at it mechanically reading without taking it in when all at once i saw a name that i had often heard my mother pronounce and each time in such eulogistic terms that all my spirits revived that name was general [verdier's] {} who had served in [egypt] {} under my father come come i said the number three is a [favourite] {favorite} with the gods perhaps my third unknown and providential protector will do more for me than the other two which would be no great tax seeing the others have not done anything at all general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} lived in the [faubourg] {} [montmartre] {} no 6 ten minutes later i was holding the following terse dialogue with the concierge of his house does general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} live here please fourth floor small door on the left i made the concierge repeat it i believed i must have misunderstood him marshal [jourdan] {} and general [sébastiani] {} lived in sumptuous mansions in the [faubourg] {} saint [germain] {} and the [faubourg] {} saint [honoré] {honors, honor} entrance was gained to these mansions by gates like those of [gaza] {gala, gaze} why then should general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} live in the rue [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [faubourg] {} [montmartre] {} on the fourth floor and why did one gain access to him through a small doorway the concierge repeated his words i had not misunderstood good gracious i said as i climbed the staircase this does not look like marshal [jourdan's] {} lackeys nor marshal [sébastiani's] {} [swiss] {swigs, swims, swish} guards general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} fourth floor small door on the left surely this is a man likely to remember my father i reached the fourth floor i discovered the small door at this door hung a humble modest green string i rang with an uncontrollable fluttering at my heart this third trial was to decide my opinion of men steps approached the door was opened a man of about sixty opened the door he wore a cap edged with [astrakan] {astrakhan} and was clothed in a green braided jacket and trousers of white calf skin he held in his hand a palette full of paints and under his thumb which held his palette was a paint brush i looked at the other doors i beg your pardon monsieur i said i am afraid i have made some mistake what is your pleasure monsieur asked the man with the palette to present my compliments to general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} in that case step in here you are i went in and when we had crossed a tiny square hall which served as an ante chamber i found myself in a studio you will allow me to go on with my work monsieur said the painter placing himself in front of a [battlepiece] {} in the construction of which i had interrupted him certainly but will you have the goodness monsieur to inform me where i shall find the general the painter turned round the general what general general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} why i am he you i stared with such rude surprise at him that he began to laugh it astonishes you to see me handle the brush so badly said he after having heard maybe that i handled a sword passably what would you have me do i have an active hand and i must keep it always occupied somehow but come as evidently after the question you put to me just now you have nothing to say to the painter what do you want with the general i am the son of your old comrade at arms in [egypt] {} general [dumas] {pumas, dumps} he turned round quickly towards me and looked at me earnestly then after a moment's silence he said by the powers so you are you are the very image of him tears immediately came into his eyes and throwing down his brush he held out his hand to me which i longed to kiss rather than to shake ah you remember him then remember him i should think i do the handsomest and the bravest man in the army you are the very spit of him my lad what a model he would have made any painter yes you are right i remember him perfectly and what brings you to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} my dear boy for if my memory serves me you lived with your mother in some village or other true general but my mother is getting on in years and we are poor we are both in the same boat he said so i went on i have come to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} in the hope of obtaining a small situation now that it is my turn to provide for her as hitherto she has provided for me that is well thought of but my poor lad a place is not so easy to get in these times no matter how small especially for the son of a republican general ah if you were the son of an émigré or of a [chouan] {} if only your poor father had served in the [russian] {} or [austrian] {} army i [daresay] {} you might have had a chance the deuce general you frighten me and i had been counting on your protection what he exclaimed i repeated my sentence word for word but with a little less assurance my protection he shook his head and smiled sadly my poor boy he said if you wish to take lessons in painting my protection may be sufficient to provide you with them and even so you will never be a great artist if you do not surpass your master my protection well well i am grateful to you for that expression 'pon my word for you are most likely the only person in the world who would ask me for such a thing to day you flatterer excuse me general i do not rightly understand why those rascals pensioned me off for some imaginary conspiracy with [dermoncourt] {} so you see here i am painting pictures and if you want to do the same here are a palette some brushes and a thirty six canvas thanks general i have never got beyond the first stages so you see my apprenticeship would be too long and neither my mother nor i could wait ' ah what can i say my lad you know the proverb 'the prettiest girl in the world ' ah i pardon pardon i find i am mistaken i have still half my purse i had forgotten that it is true it is hardly worth troubling about he opened the drawer of a small chest in which i remember there were two gold coins and forty francs in silver there he said this is the remainder of my quarter's pay thank you general but i am nearly as wealthy as you it was my turn to have tears in my eyes thank you but perhaps you can advise me what further steps i can take you have already taken some steps then yes i set about them this morning ah ah and who have you seen i saw marshal [jourdan] {} and general [sébastiani] {} pooh well well general pooh and after that and after that i wrote yesterday to the minister of war to [bellune] {} yes and has he answered you not yet but i hope he will reply to me the general while he filled in the face of a [cossack] {} made a grimace which might be summed up in the words if you are counting only on that i have still i added in response to his thought a letter of introduction to general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} deputy of my own department very well my dear boy as i believe that even if you have time to lose you have no money to spare i advise you not to wait for the minister's answer to morrow is [tuesday] {} there is a sitting of the chamber but present yourself early at general [foy's] {boy's, joy's, soy's, toy's, fly's} you will find him at work for he is a hard worker like myself only he does better work don't worry he will receive you kindly you think so i am sure of it i hope so for i have a letter yes he will give you a kindly reception i have no doubt because of your letter but above all he will receive you well for your father's sake although he did not know him personally now will you dine with me we will talk of [egypt] {} it was hot there willingly general at what hour do you dine at six o'clock now go and take a turn on the boulevards whilst i finish my [cossack] {} and return at six i took leave of general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} and descended from the fourth floor i must confess with a lighter heart than i had ascended to it chapter [vi] {hi, mi, pi, ti, vs} [régulus] {} [talma] {} and the play general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} the letter of recommendation and the interview the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [bellune's] {} reply i obtain a place as temporary clerk with m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} journey to [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} to tell my mother the good news no 9 i gain a prize in a lottery men and things began to appear to me in their true light and the world which until now had been hidden from me in the mists of illusion began to show itself as it really is as god and the devil have made it interspersed with good and evil spotted with dirt i related to [adolphe] {} everything that had occurred go on he said if your story finishes as it has begun you will accomplish much more than the writing of a comic opera you will write a comedy but [adolphe's] {} thoughts were in reality busy on my behalf [régulus] {} was to be played at the [théâtre] {} [français] {} that night he had asked for two orchestra stalls from [lucien] {} [arnault] {} and had kept them for me only on that evening he would be too busy to come with me the [pauvre] {} [fille] {fills, filly, file, file, fill} claimed every minute of his time i was almost glad of this inability i could thus take general [verdier] {nerdier, verier} to the play in return for his dinner i found him waiting for me at his house at six o'clock i showed him my two tickets and laid my proposal before him well well well he said i cannot refuse this i do not often allow myself the luxury of going to the play and especially as it is [talma] {} you know some dramatists then yes i know m [arnault] {} very good and now i must confess general that i want to stay in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} really to go in for literature ah not really really general listen you came to ask my advice certainly i did very well don't count too much on literature for a living you look as though you had a good appetite now literature will necessitate your going hungry many a time however on those days you must look me up the painter always shares his crusts with the poet [ut] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [pictura] {picture} [poesis] {} i do not need to interpret that for i presume you know [latin] {satin, lain} a little general that is much more than i do come let us go and dine do we not dine at your rooms do you imagine i am rich enough on my half pay to keep up a kitchen and a household no no no indeed i dine at the [palais] {} royal for forty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} to day we will have an extra and i can get it for six francs you see you are not going to cost me much so need not be anxious we betook ourselves to the [palais] {} royal where indeed we dined excellently for our six francs or rather for general [verdier's] {} six francs then we went to take our places for [régulus] {} my mind was still full of [sylla] {} i saw the gloomy dictator enter with his flattened locks his crowned head his forehead furrowed with anxieties his speech was deliberate almost solemn his glance that of a lynx and a hyena shot from under his drooping eyelids like that of a nocturnal animal which sees in the darkness thus i awaited [talma] {} he entered at a rapid pace with haughty head and terse speech as befitted the general of a free people and a conquering nation he entered in short as [régulus] {} would have entered no longer the toga no longer the purple no longer the crown a simple tunic bound by an iron girdle without any other cloak than that of the soldier here was where [talma] {} was admirable in his personality always that of the hero he was called upon to represent he reconstructed a world he

[pressingly] {} he is very fond of you then almost as fond as he is of his own son general i must first find out what you are fit for oh not good for much bah you surely know some mathematics no general you have at least some notion of algebra of geometry of physics he stopped between each word and at each word i blushed afresh and the perspiration ran down my forehead in faster and faster

questions to which i have just now said 'no ' but have you anything to live upon in the meantime my young friend nothing absolutely nothing general i replied crushed by the feeling of my powerlessness the general looked at me in profound pity nevertheless he said i do not want to abandon you no general for you will not be abandoning me only true i am ignorant and good for nothing but my mother counts upon me i have promised her i will find a place and she ought not to be punished for my ignorance and my laziness give me your address said the general i will consider what can be done for you write there at that desk he held the pen out to me which he had just been using i took it i looked at it still wet then shaking my head i gave it back to him what is the matter no general i said i cannot write with your pen it would be a profanation he smiled what a child you are he said look here is a new one thanks i wrote the general looked on i had scarcely written my name before he clapped his hands together we are saved he said how is that you write a beautiful hand my head fell on my breast my shame was insupportable the only thing i possessed was a good handwriting this diploma of incapacity well became me a beautiful handwriting so some day i might become a copying clerk that was my future i would rather cut off my right arm general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} went on without paying much heed to what was passing through my mind listen he said i am dining to day at the [palais] {} royal i will mention you to the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} i will tell him he ought to take the son of a republican general into his offices sit down there he pointed to an empty desk draw up a petition and write your very best i obeyed when i had finished general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} took my petition read it and traced a few lines in the margin his handwriting compared [unfavourably] {unfavorably} with mine and humiliated me most cruelly then he folded up the petition put it in his pocket and holding out his hand to bid me good bye he invited me to return and lunch with him next day i returned to my hotel in the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} and there i found a letter franked by the minister of war good and evil fortune had up to this time treated me pretty impartially the letter that i was about to break open should turn the scale definitely the minister replied that as he had no time for a personal interview he invited me to lay before him anything i had to say in writing decidedly the balance of the scale was towards ill fortune i replied that the audience i asked of him was but to hand him the original of a letter of thanks he had once written to my father his general in chief but that as i might not have the [honour] {honor} of seeing him i would content myself with sending him a copy of it poor marshal i have seen him since he was then as affectionate to me as he had been indifferent under the circumstances i have just related and nowadays his son and his grandson are my good friends i went early next morning as i had been advised to general [foy's] {boy's, joy's, soy's, toy's, fly's} who was now my only hope the general was at his work as on the previous day he received me with a smiling face which looked very promising well he said our business is settled i looked at him astounded how is that i asked yes you are to enter the secretarial staff of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} as supernumerary at twelve hundred francs it is nothing very great but mow is your chance to work it is a fortune and when am i to begin next [monday] {} if you like next [monday] {} yes it is arranged with the chief clerk in the office what is his name m [oudard] {} you will introduce yourself to him in my name oh general i can hardly believe my good fortune the general looked at me with an indescribably kindly expression this reminded me that i had not even thanked him i threw my arms round his neck and kissed him he began to laugh there is good stuff in you he said but remember what you have promised me study oh yes general i am now going to live by my handwriting but i promise you that one day i shall live by my pen we shall see take your pen and write to your mother no general no i wish to tell her this good news with my own lips to day is

will go to my office but you will ruin yourself in carriages no i have a free pass from the diligence proprietor and i related to him how old [cartier] {wartier, cattier, carrier, artier} owed me a dozen fares now i asked of the general what message shall i take from you to m [danré] {} well tell him we had lunch together and that i am very well a small round table ready laid was carried in at this juncture a second cover ordered the general really general you make me ashamed have you lunched no but to table to table i have to be at the chamber by noon we lunched [tête] {tote} à [tête] {tote} the general talked to me of my future plans i confided all my literary plans to him he looked at me he listened to me with the benevolent smile of a large [hearted] {hearten, heated} man he seemed to say golden dreams foolish hopes purple but fugitive clouds which sail over the heaven of youth may they not vanish into the azure firmament too quickly for my poor [protégé] {} beloved and

let to me for the sum of a hundred and twenty francs per [annum] {annul} it suited me in every respect so i did not haggle i told the porter i would take it and i advised him that my furniture would come in on the following night the porter asked me for the denier à [dieu] {lieu, died, dies, diet, die} i was a complete stranger to [parisian] {} habits and i did not know what the denier à [dieu] {lieu, died, dies, diet, die} meant i thought it must be a commission on letting the room i majestically took a [napoleon] {} out of my pocket and i dropped it into the hand of the porter who bowed down to the ground in his eyes i evidently passed for a prince [travelling] {traveling, traveling} incognito to give twenty francs as denier à [dieu] {lieu, died, dies, diet, die} for a room at a hundred and twenty such a thing had never been heard of twenty francs it was a sixth of the rent so his wife instantly asked for the [honour] {honor} of looking after me i granted her this [favour] {favor} for five francs per month always with the same regal air from there i ran to general [verdier's] {} to get up my appetite and i told him the good news i had left [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} at such short notice on the previous [monday] {} that i had not had time to ascend his four flights of stairs i mounted them this time fruitlessly the general had taken advantage of its being [sunday] {sundry, sundae} and had gone out i followed his example i strolled about the boulevards the only place where i ran no risk of being lost and i reached the [café] {cafe} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint [honoré] {honors, honor} at the end of my strolling suddenly through the windows i saw someone i knew it was [hiraux] {} the son of good old [hiraux] {} who had so unsuccessfully [endeavoured] {endeavored} to make a musician of me i entered the [café] {cafe} [hiraux] {} had recently bought it he was the proprietor of it i was in his house although he was slightly older than myself we had been very good chums in our childhood he kept me to dinner while waiting for dinner he put all the journals of the establishment before me some of those papers have since disappeared the chief of them at that time were the journal [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [débats] {} always under the direction of the brothers [bertin] {} and a supporter of the government it reflected the views of [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} and of m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [villèle] {} namely a moderate and conciliatory [royalism] {royalist} a policy of optimism and vacillation the system in fact by which in the midst of the plots of the [carbonari] {} and the intrigues of the extreme party [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} managed to die almost in [tranquillity] {tranquility, tranquility} if not on the throne at any rate close by it the old [constitutionnel] {} of saint [albin] {albino} jay [tissot] {} and Évariste [dumoulin] {} was suppressed one day for an article which the censorship placed on the index an article which somehow had managed to get inserted without any trace of the claws and teeth of the censors then with a rapidity of decision which indicated the extreme devotion the [constitutionnel] {} of every epoch has always exhibited in its own cause it bought for a mere song the journal [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} commerce which had four hundred subscribers and under the title of the journal [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} commerce appeared next morning it need hardly be said that the good old rogue was [recognised] {recognized} under this transparent disguise and just about the time when i arrived in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} it had resumed or was about to resume its old title so dear to the citizens of [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} the [constitutionnel] {} was very timid it represented the liberal opinion and never really breathed out thunder and lightning except against the [jesuits] {} towards whom it had vowed the same cruel and magnificent hatred that nowadays it fulminates against demagogues the [drapeau] {} [blanc] {bland, blank, blanch} was edited by [martainville] {} a man of infinite resource but one who could hate and was hated in return charged with the [defence] {defense} of the bridge of [pecq] {peck, pecs} as commandant of the national guard of saint [germain] {} he was reproached with having in 1814 delivered up this bridge to the [prussians] {} and he replied to the reproach not merely by an avowal but with bravado not being able to deny it he boasted about it but as all treachery torments the heart of the man who has committed it irrespective of what he said so it preyed on his vital forces m [arnault] {} had infuriated him by deriving his name from martin on his father's and [vil] {ail, mil, nil, oil, vol} (vile) on his mother's side he was courageous enough and ever ready to tackle an adversary he did battle with [telleville] {} [arnault] {} over his [germanicus] {} the bullet of the poet's son merely grazed the thigh of the critic leaving nothing worse than a slight bruise behind it bah said [arnault's] {} father he has not even felt it a blow from a stick would have produced the same effect the [foudre] {} was the admitted journal of the [marsan] {} party the outspoken expression of the ultra royalists who through all the reactions that followed [leant] {meant, least, leans, lent, lean} for support on the [comte] {cote, come} [d'artois] {} and who waited impatiently for that decomposition of the elements which at the rate things were going could not fail to be accomplished under [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} the editors of the [foudre] {} were [bérard] {} the two brothers [dartois] {} (who were also comic opera [writers)] {writers} [théaulon] {} and [ferdinand] {} [langlé] {} [brisset] {brisket} and [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [rancé] {ranch} at the opposite pole of liberal opinion to the [foudre] {} was the [miroir] {} a newspaper hussar a delightful [skirmisher] {skirmished, skirmishes} overflowing with wit and [humour] {humor} it was controlled by all the men who were noted for their spirit of opposition to the times and who we hasten to say were really opposed to it these men were mm [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} [arnault] {} [jal] {cal, gal, pal, jab, jag} [coste] {caste, costs, cote, cost, costed} [castel] {pastel, cartel, caster, castes, caste} [moreau] {} etc so the unfortunate [miroir] {} was the object of relentless persecution at the hands of the government in whose eyes it was for ever flashing a broken ray of sunlight from the days of the empire suppressed as the [miroir] {} it reappeared as the [pandore] {} suppressed as [pandore] {} it became the opinion suppressed finally as opinion it rose again under the title of the reunion but this was the last of its metamorphoses [proteus] {} was run to earth and died in chains do not let us forget the [courrier] {courtier, courier, courier} [français] {} the sentinel of advanced opinion almost republican at a time when no one dared even to pronounce the word republic it was for the [courrier] {courtier, courier, courier} [français] {} edited by [châtelain] {} one of the most honest and most enlightened patriots of that period that as i have already mentioned m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [leuven] {leaven} worked but i had really nothing to do with any of these political journals i only read the literary news as i had found a dinner which cost me nothing i decided to spend the price of my dinner on a [theatre] {} ticket a ticket for a play i hunted through the [theatre] {} advertisements in all the newspapers and guided by [hiraux] {} in the choice of the literature on which i proposed to spend my evening i decided to go to the [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint martin the play was the vampire it was only the third or fourth representation of the revival of this piece [hiraux] {} advised me to make haste the piece had caught on and was drawing crowds it was played by the two actors who were popular at the [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint martin [philippe] {} and madame [dorval] {dorsal} i followed [hiraux's] {} advice but in spite of all the haste i made it is a long way from the [café] {cafe} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint [honoré] {honors, honor} to the [theatre] {} of the [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint martin i found the approaches to it blocked i was quite fresh to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} i did not know all the various [theatre] {} customs i went along by the side of an enormous queue enclosed in barriers not daring even to ask where the entrance money was taken one of the [habitués] {habitues} in the queue no doubt perceived my confusion for he called out to me monsieur monsieur i turned round wondering if he were addressing me yes you monsieur continued the [habitué] {habitue} you with the frizzy locks do you want a place do i want a place i repeated yes if you put yourself at the bottom of this queue you will never get in to night five hundred people will be turned away this was [hebrew] {} to me of his language i only gathered that five hundred folk would be turned away and that i should be one of the number come would you really like my place continued the [habitué] {habitue} have you got a place then can't you see for yourself i could see nothing at all taken in advance then i asked taken since noon and a good one what do you mean by good now it was the [habitué] {habitue} who did not understand well i went on shall i have a good place you can sit where you like what i can sit where i like of course how much did your place cost twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} i reflected within myself that twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} to sit where i liked was not dear i drew twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} from my pocket and gave them to the [habitué] {habitue} who immediately with an agility that proved he was well accustomed to this exercise climbed up the rails of the barrier got over it and alighted by my side well i said now where is your place take it but look sharp for if they push up you will lose it at the same moment light broke in on my mind those people inside that barrier have no doubt taken and paid for their places in advance and it is in order to keep them they are penned in like that ah good i see i replied and i strode over the barrier in my turn the reverse way so that contrary to the action of my place seller who had come without from within i went from the outside within i did not understand matters at all after a second there was a movement forward they were just opening the offices i was carried forward with the crowd and ten minutes later i found myself in front of the grating well monsieur aren't you going to take your ticket asked my [neighbour] {neighbor} my ticket what do you mean of course your ticket answered someone just behind me if you aren't going to take your ticket at least allow us to take ours and a light thrust showed the desire of those behind me to have their turn but i said surely i have bought my place your place yes i gave twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} for it as you saw why i gave twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} to that man who sold me his place oh his place in the queue exclaimed my [neighbours] {neighbors} but his place in the queue is not his place inside the [theatre] {} he told me that with his place i could go where i liked of course you can go where you like take a stage box you can do what you like and you can go where you like but tickets for the stage boxes are at the other office forward forward hurry up exclaimed those near me gentlemen clear the gangway if you please cried a voice it is this gentleman who will not take his ticket and who prevents us from getting ours cried a chorus of my [neighbours] {neighbors} come come make up your mind the murmurs grew and with them ringing in my ears by degrees it dawned upon me what had been pretty clearly dinned into me namely that i had bought my place in the queue and not my place in the [theatre] {} so as people were beginning to hustle me in a threatening fashion i drew a six francs piece from my pocket and asked for a pit ticket they gave me four francs six [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} and a ticket which had been white it was time i was immediately carried away by a wave of the crowd i presented my once white ticket to the check taker they gave me in exchange a ticket that had been red i went down a corridor to the left i found a door on my left with the word parterre written over it and i entered and now i understood the truth of what the [habitué] {habitue} who had sold me his place for twenty [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} had said although i had scarcely fifteen or twenty people in front of me in the queue the pit was nearly full a most compact nucleus had formed beneath the lights and i [realised] {realized} then that those must be the best places i immediately resolved to mix with this group which did not look to me to be too closely packed for a good place therein i climbed over the benches as i had seen several other people do and balancing myself on the tops of their curved backs i hastened to reach the [centre] {} i was becoming or rather it must be admitted i was a very ridiculous object i wore my hair very long and as it was frizzy it formed a grotesque aureole round my head moreover at a period when people wore short frock coats hardly reaching to the knee i wore a coat which came down to my ankles a revolution had taken place in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} which had not yet had time to reach as far as [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i was in 1 the latest fashion of [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} but i was in the last but one [parisian] {} mode now as nothing generally is more opposed to the latest fashion than the last mode but one i looked excessively absurd as i have already had the modesty to admit of course i appeared so in the eyes of those towards whom i advanced for they greeted me with shouts of laughter which i thought in very bad taste i have always been exceedingly polite but at this period coupled with the politeness i had acquired from my maternal education there woke in me a restless suspicious hastiness of temper which i probably inherited from my father this hastiness made my nerves an easy prey to irritation i took my hat in my hand an action which revealed the utter oddity of my way of wearing my hair and the general hilarity among the group in the rows to which i desired to gain access redoubled pardon me gentlemen i said in the politest of tones but i should like to know the cause of your laughter so that i may be able to laugh with you they say the piece we have come to see is extremely sad and i should not be sorry to make merry before i have to weep my speech was listened to in the most religious silence then from the depths of this silence a voice suddenly exclaimed oh that 'ead of 'is the apostrophe seemed to be exceedingly funny for it had hardly been uttered before the bursts of laughter were redoubled but the hilarity had scarcely begun afresh before it was accompanied by the sound of a stinging smack in the face which i gave to the wag monsieur i said as i slapped him my name is [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} until after to morrow you will find me at the [hôtel] {hotel} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieux] {} [augustins] {} in the road of the same name and after to morrow at no 1 place [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [italiens] {} it would seem that i spoke a language quite unknown to these gentlemen for instead of replying to me twenty fists were flourished threateningly and everybody shouted put him out put him out what i cried put me to the door that would be a nice thing upon my word seeing that i have already paid for my place twice over once in the queue and then again at the box office put him out put him out cried the voices afresh with redoubled fury gentlemen i have had the [honour] {honor} to give you my address put him out put him out cried the people in strident raucous tones all the people present had risen from their seats were leaning over the gallery and were almost half out of the boxes i seemed to be at the end of an immense funnel with everybody gazing at me from all sides put him out put him out cried those who did not even know what the commotion was about but who calculated that one person less would mean room for one more i was debating what course to take from the depths of my funnel when a well dressed man broke through the crowd which deferentially opened a way for him and he asked me to go out why am i to go out i asked in great surprise because you are disturbing the performance what i am disturbing the play the play has not begun yet well you are disturbing the audience really monsieur follow me i remembered the affair that my father at about my age had had with a musketeer at la [montansier] {} and although i knew that the constabulary was dissolved i expected i was in for something of the same sort so i followed without making any resistance in the midst of the cheers of the audience who testified their satisfaction at the justice that was being dealt out to me my guide led me into the corridor from the corridor to the office and from the office into the street when in the street he said there don't do it again and he returned to the [theatre] {} i saw that i had got off very cheaply since my father had kept his warder attached to him for a whole week whilst i had only been in custody for five minutes i stood for a moment on the pavement whilst i made this judicious reflection and seeing that my guide had re entered i too decided to do the same your ticket said the ticket collector my ticket you took it from me just now and as a proof it was a white one for which you gave me in exchange a red ticket then what have you done with your red ticket i gave it to a woman who asked me for it so that you have neither ticket nor check why no i have neither ticket nor check then you cannot go in do you mean to say i cannot enter after having paid for my ticket twice over twice yes twice how did you do that once in the queue and again at the box office you humbug said the ticket collector what did you say i said you cannot go in that is what i said but i mean to get in nevertheless then take a ticket at the office that will be the second well what does that matter to me what does it matter to you if you have sold your ticket at the door it is no affair of mine ah so you take me for a dealer in checks i take you for a brawler who has just been turned out for disturbing the peace and if you go on doing it you'll not be led out into the road the next time but into the police station there could be no mistaking the threat i began to understand that without intending it i had infringed the law or rather custom which is far more jealous of contravention than the law ah is this so i said that is about it said the collector well well you are the stronger of the two i said and i went out when outside the door i considered how stupid it was to have come to see a play to have paid for two places to see it a place in the queue and a place at the office to have seen only a curtain representing hangings of green velvet and to come away without seeing anything else i went on to reflect that since i had already paid for two tickets i might as well incur the expense of a third and as people were still going in and a double queue circled the [theatre] {} so that the door formed as it were the clasp to the girdle i placed myself at the end of the queue which looked to me to be the shortest it was the opposite queue to the one i had gone in by before it was not so dense as it led to the orchestra the front galleries the stage boxes and the first and second rows of stalls this was what i was informed by the clerk at the box office when i asked for a ticket for the pit i looked up and as he had indicated i saw upon the white plan the designation of the places to be obtained at that particular office the cheapest places were those in the orchestra and second row of stalls seats in the orchestra and in the second row of stalls cost two francs fifty centimes i took two francs fifty centimes from my pocket and asked for an orchestra seat the orchestra ticket was handed to me and my play going cost me five francs all told no matter it was no good crying over [spilt] {stilt, spill, silt, spit} milk my dinner had not cost me anything and to morrow i was to enter the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans'] {} secretarial offices i could well afford to allow myself this trivial orgy i reappeared triumphant before the check barrier holding my orchestra ticket in my hand the collector smiled graciously upon me and said on the right monsieur i noticed this was quite a different direction from the first time the first time i had tacked myself on to the right hand queue and gone in at the left the second time i followed the left queue and they told me to enter on the right i augured from this that since i had this time reversed the order of my proceedings the manner of my reception would also be reversed and consequently that i should be welcomed instead of rejected i was not mistaken i found quite a different stamp of people in the orchestra from those i had found in the pit and as the girl who showed me to my seat pointed out to me a vacant place towards the [centre] {} of a row i set to work to reach it everyone rose politely to allow me to pass i gained my seat and sat down by the side of a gentleman wearing [grey] {prey, gray, grew} trousers a buff waistcoat and black tie he was a man of about forty or forty two his hat was placed on the seat i came to fill he was interrupted in the perusal of a charming little book which i [learnt] {learns, learn} later was an [elzevir] {} [apologised] {apologized} as he took up his hat bowed to me and went on reading upon my word i said to myself here is a gentleman who seems to me better brought up than those i have just encountered and promising to enter into friendly relations with my [neighbour] {neighbor} i sat down in the empty stall chapter [viii] {} my [neighbour] {neighbor} his portrait the [pastissier] {} [françois] {} a course in [bibliomania] {} madame [méchin] {} and the governor of [soissons] {} cannons and [elzevirs] {} at this period of my life being made up entirely of ignorance optimism and faith i did not know in the least what an [elzevir] {} or rather [elzevier] {} was i [learnt] {learns, learn} that evening as we shall see but i did not understand thoroughly until much later after i had made the acquaintance of my learned friend la bibliophile [jacob] {} so it is a little previous to say that the polite gentleman was reading an [elzevir] {} i ought to say simply that he was reading a book i have related how i had taken the seat next his and how having been distracted from his reading by having to lift his hat off my seat he had immediately plunged back again into his reading more [absorbedly] {} than ever i have ever admired men who are capable of doing anything whole [heartedly] {heatedly} (passionnément ) please do not confound [passionnément] {} with [passionnellement] {} this latter adverb was not invented in 1823 or if it were [fourier] {courier} had not yet exploited it it was not surprising that interested as i was in literature i should [endeavour] {endeavor} to find out what the book was which could inspire such a powerful influence over my [neighbour] {neighbor} who was so deeply absorbed in his reading that metaphorically speaking he gave himself up bound hand and foot into my power i had more than a quarter of an hour in which to make this investigation before the curtain rose therefore i conducted it at my leisure first of all i tried to see the title of the book but the binding was carefully hidden by a paper cover so it was impossible to read the title on the back of the book i rose in that position i could look down on the reader then thanks to the excellent sight i have the good fortune to possess i was able to read the following curious title on the opposite side to the engraved frontispiece [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [pastissier] {} [franÇois] {} [où] {of, oh, on, or, ow} est [enseignée] {} la [manière] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we}

{louts} [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [daniel] {} [elzÉvier] {} 1655 ah ah i said to myself now i have it this well mannered gentleman is surely a gourmand of the first order m [grimod] {grimed} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [reyniere] {} perhaps whom i have so often heard described as a rival of [cambacérès] {} and of [d'aigrefeuille] {} but stay this gentleman has hands and m [grimod] {grimed} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [reyniere] {} has only stumps at that moment the polite gentleman let his hand and the book he held fall on his knees then casting his eyes upward he appeared to be lost in profound reflection he was as i have said a man of forty or forty two years of age with an essentially gentle face kindly and sympathetic he had black hair blue [grey] {prey, gray, grew} eyes a nose slightly bent to the left through an excrescence a finely cut clever looking witty mouth the mouth of a born story teller i was yearning to get up a conversation with him i a [hobbledehoy] {} of a country bumpkin ignorant of everything but anxious to learn as they put it in m [lhomond's] {} elementary lessons his benevolent countenance encouraged me i took advantage of the moment when he stopped reading to address a word or two to him monsieur said i pray forgive me if my question seems impertinent but are you extremely fond of eggs my [neighbour] {neighbor} shook his head came gradually out of his reverie and looking at me with a distraught expression he said in a very pronounced eastern french accent pardon me monsieur but i believe you did me the [honour] {honor} of addressing me i repeated my sentence why do you suppose that he said the little book you are reading so attentively monsieur excuse my rudeness but my eyes fell involuntarily on the title contains recipes does it not for cooking eggs in more than sixty different ways oh yes true he said monsieur that book would have been of great use to an uncle of mine a [curé] {curb, curd, cure, curl, curs} who was or rather still is a great eater and a fine sportsman one day he made a bet with one of his [confrères] {confreres} that he would eat a hundred eggs at his dinner he was only able to discover eighteen or twenty ways of serving them yes twenty ways for he ate them by fives at a time you see if he had known sixty ways of cooking them instead of a hundred he could have eaten two hundred my [neighbour] {neighbor} looked at me with a certain attention which seemed to imply that he was asking himself am i by any chance seated next to a young lunatic well he said well if i could procure such a book for my dear uncle i am sure he would be most grateful to me monsieur said my [neighbour] {neighbor} i doubt if in spite of the sentiments which do a nephew's heart the greatest credit you could procure this book why not because it is exceedingly rare that little old book exceedingly rare do you not know that it is an [elzevir] {} monsieur no do you not know what an [elzevir] {} is exclaimed my [neighbour] {neighbor} overwhelmed with astonishment no monsieur no but do not be alarmed at such a trifle since i came to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} not quite a week ago i have discovered that i am ignorant of nearly everything tell me what it is please i am not well enough off to afford myself masters i am too old to go back to college and i have made up my mind to take the whole world as my teacher a teacher whom report says is even more learned than [voltaire] {} ah ah quite right monsieur said my [neighbour] {neighbor} looking at me with some interest and if you profit by the lessons that teacher will give you you will become a great philosopher as well as a great savant well what is an [elzevir] {} first of all and in particular this little volume that you see is one or in general every book that came from the establishment of [louis] {louts} [elzevir] {} and of his successors booksellers of [amsterdam] {} but do you know what a [bibliomaniac] {} is i do not know [greek] {creek, greed, green, greet, reek} monsieur you know your ignorance and that is something the [bibliomaniac] {} root ß ß book µa a madness is a variety of the species man species

wears on his feet shoes that are down at the heel a dirty hat on his head and under his coat and over his trousers a waistcoat fastened together with string one of the signs by which he can be [recognised] {recognized} is that he never washes his hands but you are describing a perfectly disgusting animal i hope the race does not consist entirely of specimens like that and that there are exceptions yes but these exceptions are rare well what this creature is in particular quest after among the old shopkeepers and on the old [bookstalls] {} for you know that all animals hunt for something or other is for [elzevirs] {} are they hard to find yes more and more difficult every day and how can [elzevirs] {} be [recognised] {recognized} pray remember monsieur that you are not

editions there are anonymous and [pseudonymous] {} editions and there is where the inexperienced [bibliomaniacs] {} get confused ah will you be my [ariadne] {} well these editions are usually designated by a sphere then that is a guide yes but you will see these brothers cousins or nephews [elzevir] {} were a very capricious lot of fellows thus for example one finds since 1629 a buffalo head forming part of the [headpieces] {} in their books at the beginning of prefaces [dedicatory] {} epistles and text well thanks to the buffalo's head it seems wait a bit this lasted for five years since the [sallust] {} of 1634 and even perhaps earlier they adopted another sign which resembled a siren also in this edition the [sallust] {} of 1634 exactly they adopted also for the first time on page 216 a tail piece of a head of [medusa] {} so when once this principle is fixed and one knows that on page 216 of the [sallust] {} of 1634 there is a figure representing yes yes upon my word that would be delightful if it could be laid down as a positive rule but bah [daniel] {} did not remain constant to his designs for example in the 1661 [terence] {} he substitutes a garland of hollyhocks for the buffalo head and the siren and this garland is to be found in a great many of his editions but in the [persius] {} of 1664 he does not even put that oh gracious and what does he adopt in the [persius] {} of 1664 he adopts a large ornament in the [centre] {} of which are two swords crossed over a crown as though to indicate that the [elzevirs] {} are the kings of the book selling world you have hit it exactly monsieur a sovereignty no one disputes with them and the one you have there monsieur which treats of french confectionery and the sixty ways of cooking eggs is it the angel with the book and the scythe is it the vine cluster is it the [minerva] {} and the olive tree is it the buffalo head is it the siren is it the head of [medusa] {} is it the garland of hollyhocks or is it the crown and two swords this one monsieur is the rarest of all i found it this evening as i was coming here just think how i have argued with that idiot of a [bérard] {} over this [elzevir] {} for three years he thinks himself a great savant and is not even half instructed and without seeming too inquisitive monsieur may i ask what was the object of the discussion he would have it that [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [pastissier] {} [françois] {} was printed in 1654 and contained only four preliminary leaves whilst i maintained and with reason as you see that it was printed in 1655 and that it had five preliminary leaves and a frontispiece now here is the very date 1655 here are the five preliminary leaves here is the very frontispiece upon my word so it is ah ah how sheepish how utterly foolish my friend [bérard] {} will look now but monsieur i suggested timidly did you not tell me that you had argued over this little volume for the past three years yes indeed for more than three years well it seems to me that if the discussion no longer amused you you had a very simple remedy at hand to stop it what does not one of the ancient philosophers prove the [incontestability] {} of movement to another philosopher who denies movement by walking before him well well then you must prove to m [bérard] {} the superiority of your knowledge over his by showing him the [elzevir] {} you have there and unless he is more incredulous than [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [thomas] {} but to show it monsieur it was necessary to possess it and i had it not this little volume is then very rare it is the rarest of the lot there are probably only ten examples of it left in [europe] {} and why is this particular volume rarer than the others were there fewer copies printed on the contrary [techener] {} declares that there were five thousand five hundred copies issued and i maintain that there were more than ten thousand printed the deuce was the edition burnt then with the library of [alexandria] {} no but it was lost [spoilt] {spoils, spoil} torn up in kitchens you can quite understand that chefs and [cookmaids] {} are indifferent [bibliomaniacs] {} they served the [pastissier] {} [françois] {} as they served [carême] {} or the [cuisinier] {} royal hence the rarity of the book so rare that as you say you have not found one before to night oh i knew of it six weeks ago i told frank to keep it for me as i was not well enough off to buy it what you were not rich enough to buy it not rich enough to buy that little old book the [bibliomaniac] {} smiled disdainfully do you know monsieur he said to me what a copy of the [pastissier] {} [françois] {} is worth why i should judge it worth about a crown a copy of the [pastissier] {} [françois] {} monsieur is worth from two hundred to four hundred francs from two to four hundred francs yes indeed only a week ago old brunet the author of [manuel] {mantel, manual} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [libraires] {} an enthusiastic [elzeviriomaniac] {} inserted a notice in the papers that he was willing to pay three hundred francs for a copy such as this luckily frank did not see the notice pardon me monsieur but i warned you what an ignoramus lam you said a book like that was worth from two hundred to four hundred francs yes from two hundred to four hundred francs why is there such a difference in the price because of the margins ah the margins all the value of an [elzevir] {} consists in the width of its margins the wider they are the dearer the [elzevir] {} an [elzevir] {} without a margin is worth next to nothing they measure the margins with compasses and according as they have twelve fifteen or eighteen lines the [elzevir] {} is worth two hundred three hundred four hundred and even six hundred francs six hundred francs i am of madame [méchin's] {} way of thinking and what was madame [méchin's] {} way of thinking madame [méchin] {} is a very witty woman yes i am aware of that her husband was prefect of the department of [aisne] {aisle} i know that too well one day when she was visiting [soissons] {} with her husband the governor of the place to do her [honour] {honor} showed her the guns upon the ramparts one after the other when she had seen all the kinds of every date and every shape and had exhausted her repertory of ohs and [reallys] {really} and is it possibles madame [méchin] {} who did not know what to say next to the governor asked him 'how much does a pair of cannon cost m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [gouverneur] {} ' 'a twelve twenty four or thirty six [pounder] {bounder, founder, rounder, sounder, wounder} madame la [comtesse] {} ' 'oh let us say thirty six ' 'a pair of thirty six cannon madame ' replied the governor 'a pair of thirty six cannon might cost from eight to ten thousand francs 'well then ' replied madame [méchin] {} 'i am not going to put my money on them ' my [neighbour] {neighbor} looked at me doubtful whether i had told the story innocently or jokingly he was possibly going to question me on that head when we heard the call bell the overture began and there were cries for silence upon this i prepared myself to listen whilst my [neighbour] {neighbor} plunged more deeply than ever into the reading of his precious [elzevir] {} the curtain rose chapter [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if} prologue of the vampire the style offends my [neighbour's] {neighbor's} ear first act [idealogy] {ideology} the [rotifer] {} what the animal is its conformation its life its death and its resurrection the overture was intended to represent a storm the scene opened in the cave of [staffa] {staffs, staff} [malvina] {} slept on a tomb [oscar] {scar} sat on another a third enclosed lord [ruthven] {} who was to come out of it at a given moment the part of [malvina] {} was taken by madame [dorval] {dorsal} [oscar] {scar} or the angel of marriage by [moessard] {} lord [ruthven] {} or the vampire by [philippe] {} alas who could have known at that moment when i was looking eagerly beyond the curtain taking in the whole scene decorations and characters combined that i should be present at [philippe's] {} funeral watch by madame [dorval's] {} death bed and see [moessard] {} crowned in the prologue there was another angel called [ithuriel] {} the angel of the moon talking with the angel of marriage this was mademoiselle [denotte] {denote, denote} i do not know whether she is now living or dead the narrative was carried on between the angel of marriage and the angel of the moon two angels who as they wore the same [armour] {amour, armor} might have been taken to belong to the same family [malvina] {} had lost herself in hunting the storm terrifying her she had taken shelter in the cave of [staffa] {staffs, staff} there unable to keep awake she had fallen asleep on a tomb the angel of marriage was watching over her the angel of the moon who had slid down on a ray of the pale goddess through the cracks of the [basaltic] {} roof asked why the angel of marriage sat there and above all how it came about that there was a young girl in the grotto of [staffa] {staffs, staff} the angel of marriage replied that as [malvina] {} sister of lord [aubrey] {} was to espouse lord [marsden] {} next day he had been summoned by the importance of the occasion and that his looks when [ithuriel] {} interrupted him in the act of silently gazing upon the beautiful betrothed girl and the sadness depicted upon his face sprang from knowledge of the misfortunes in store for the young maiden who was about to fall from the arms of love into those of death then [ithuriel] {} began to understand explain thyself said [ithuriel] {} is it true that horrible phantoms come (viennent) sometimes my [neighbour] {neighbor} trembled as though an asp had bitten him in his sleep [vinssent] {} he cried [vinssent] {} 3 cries of silence burst forth all over the [theatre] {} and i too [clamoured] {glamoured, clamored} loudly for silence for i was enthralled by this opening the angel of the moon interrupted in the middle of her sentence threw an angry look across the orchestra and went on is it true that horrible phantoms come (viennent) under the cloak of the rights of marriage to suck blood from the throat of a timid maiden [vinssent] {} [vinssent] {} [vinssent] {} murmured my [neighbour] {neighbor} fresh cries of hush drowned his exclamation which it must be confessed was less bold and less startling this time than the first [oscar] {scar} replied yes and these monsters are called vampires a power whose inscrutable decrees we are not permitted to call in question has permitted certain miserable beings who are tormented by the punishments which their crimes have drawn down upon them on this earth to enjoy a frightful power which they exercise by preference over the nuptial couch and over the cradle sometimes their formidable shapes appear clothed in the hideous guise death has bestowed upon them others more highly [favoured] {favored} because their career is more brief and their future more fearful obtain permission to [reclothe] {} themselves with the fleshy [vesture] {gesture, venture} lost in the tomb and reappear before the living in the bodily shapes they formerly possessed and when do these monsters appear asked [ithuriel] {} the first hour of the morning wakes them in their [sepulchre] {} replied [oscar] {scar} when the sound of its sonorous stroke has died away among the echoes of the mountains they fall back motionless in their everlasting tombs but there is one among them over whom my power is more limited what am i saying fate herself can never go back on her decisions after having carried desolation into twenty different countries always conquered ever continuing the blood which sustains its horrible existence ever renewing its vitality in thirty six hours at one o'clock in the morning it has at length to submit to annihilation the lawful punishment of an infinite succession of crimes if it cannot at that time add yet another crime and count one more victim my god think of writing a play like that murmured my [neighbour] {neighbor} it seemed to me that he was too critical for i thought this dialogue was couched in the finest style imaginable the prologue continued several persons who had heard my [neighbour] {neighbor} gave vent to various whispered comments on the presumption of this indefatigable [interrupter] {interrupted} but as he buried himself in his [pastissier] {} [françois] {} the murmurs ceased it is unnecessary to point out that the young betrothed asleep on the tomb was the innocent heroine who was destined to be the bride of the vampire and had the public been in any doubt all their doubts would have been dispersed after the last scene of the prologue what do i hear said [ithuriel] {} thy conversation has kept me long while in these caves as the angel of the moon asks this question the silvery chime of a distant clock is heard striking one and the reverberation is repeated in echoes again and again [oscar] {scar} stay and see all the tombs open as the hour sounds pale shades rise half out of their graves and then fall back under their monumental stones as the sound of the echoes dies away a [spectre] {spectra} clad in a shroud escapes from the most conspicuous of these tombs his face is exposed he glides to the place where miss [aubrey] {} sleeps exclaiming [malvina] {} [oscar] {scar} withdraw [spectre] {spectra} she belongs to me [oscar] {scar} puts his arms round the sleeping girl she belongs to god and thou wilt soon belong to the regions of nothingness the [spectre] {spectra} retires but repeats threateningly to nothingness [ithuriel] {} crosses the stage in a cloud the scene changes and represents an apartment in the house of sir [aubrey] {} absurd absurd exclaimed my [neighbour] {neighbor} and he resumed his reading of [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [pastissier] {} [françois] {} i did not at all agree with him i thought the staging magnificent i had nothing to say about [malvina] {} for she had not spoken but [philippe] {} seemed to me exceedingly fine notwithstanding his paleness and [moessard] {} very good moreover crude as it was it was an attempt at romanticism a movement almost entirely unknown at that time this intervention of immaterial and superior beings in human destiny had a fanciful side to it which pleased my imagination and maybe that evening was responsible for the germ in me from which sprang the don [juan] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [marana] {marina, maraca} of eleven years later the play began sir [aubrey] {} (the reader will see presently why i underline the word [sir)] {sire, sirs, sir} sir [aubrey] {} met lord [ruthven] {} a rich [english] {} [traveller] {traveler, traveler} at [athens] {} and they became friends during their [wanderings] {wandering} about the [parthenon] {} and their day dreams by the seashore they planned means for tying the bonds of their friendship more firmly and subject to [malvina's] {} consent they decided upon a union between the young girl who was at home in the castle of [staffa] {staffs, staff} and the noble [traveller] {traveler, traveler} who had become her brother's closest friend unfortunately during an excursion which [aubrey] {} and [ruthven] {} made to the suburbs of [athens] {} to attend the wedding of a young maiden endowed privately by lord [ruthven] {} the two companions were attacked by brigands a sharp [defence] {defense} put the assassins to flight but lord [ruthven] {} was struck down mortally wounded his last words were a request that his friend would place him on a hillock bathed by the moon's rays [aubrey] {} carried out this last request and laid the dying man on the place indicated then as his friend's eyes closed and his breathing ceased [aubrey] {} began to search for his scattered [servitors] {} but when he returned with them an hour later the body had disappeared [aubrey] {} fancied that the assassins must have taken the body away to remove all traces of their crime when he returned to [scotland] {} he broke the news of lord [ruthven's] {} death to his brother lord [marsden] {} and told him of the close relationship that had united them during their travels then [marsden] {} claimed succession to his brother's rights and proposed to marry [malvina] {} if [malvina] {} would consent to this substitution [malvina] {} who did not know either the one or the other made no objection to lord [marsden's] {} claim or to her brother's wishes lord [marsden] {} is announced [malvina] {} feels that slight embarrassment which like an early morning mist always comes over the hearts of young maidens at the approach of their betrothed [aubrey] {} overjoyed rushes to greet him but when he sees him he utters a cry of surprise it is not lord [marsden] {} that is to say a person hitherto unknown who stands before him it is his friend lord [ruthven] {} [aubrey's] {} astonishment is intense but all is explained [ruthven] {} did not die he only fainted the coolness of the night air brought him back to consciousness [aubrey's] {} departure and his return to [scotland] {} had been too prompt for [ruthven] {} to send him word but when he was well he returned to [ireland] {} to find his brother dead he inherited his name and his fortune and under that name with twice the fortune he had before he offered to espouse [malvina] {} and rejoiced in anticipation at the joy he would cause his beloved [aubrey] {} by his reappearance before him [ruthven] {} is charming his friend has not overrated him he and [malvina] {} were both so [favourably] {favorably} impressed with one another that under the pretext of very urgent business he asked to be allowed to marry her within twenty four hours [malvina] {} makes a proper show of resistance before yielding they return to [marsden's] {} castle the curtain falls now i had been watching my [neighbour] {neighbor} almost as much as the play and to my great satisfaction i had seen him close his [elzevir] {} and listen to the final scenes when the curtain fell he uttered an exclamation of disdain accompanied by a deep drawn sigh pooh he said i took advantage of this moment to renew our conversation excuse me monsieur i said but at the conclusion of the prologue you said 'how absurd ' yes said my [neighbour] {neighbor} i suppose i did say so or if i did not say it i certainly thought it do you then condemn the use of supernatural beings in the drama not at all on the contrary i admire it extremely all the great masters have made potent use of it [shakespeare] {} in hamlet in [macbeth] {} and in [julius] {} [cæsar] {} [molière] {} in [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [festin] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [pierre] {pierce} which he ought rather to have called [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [convive] {connive} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [pierre] {pierce} for his title to be really significant [voltaire] {} in [sémiramis] {} [goethe] {} in [faust] {fault, fast} no on the contrary i highly approve of the use of the supernatural because i believe in it what you have faith in the supernatural most certainly in everyday life certainly we elbow every moment against beings who are unknown to us because they are invisible to us the air fire the earth are all inhabited sylphs gnomes water sprites hobgoblins bogies angels demons fly float crawl and leap around us what are those shooting stars of the night meteors which astronomers in vain try to explain to us and of which they can discover neither cause nor end if they are not angels carrying god's orders from one world to another some day we shall see it all did you say we shall see yes by heaven we shall see do you not think that we see these miracles you said 'we' do you think we personally shall see them well i did not exactly say that not i for i am already old perhaps you who are still young but certainly our descendants and why for heaven's sake will our descendants see anything that we cannot see in the same way that we see things which our ancestors never did what things do we see which they did not why steam piston guns air balloons electricity printing gunpowder do you suppose the world progresses only to stop half way do you imagine that after having conquered successively the earth water and fire man for instance will not make himself master of the air it would be ridiculous to hold that belief if perchance you doubt it young man so much the worse for you i confess one thing monsieur and that is i neither doubt nor believe my mind has never dwelt on such theories i have been wrong i see since they can be interesting and i should take to them if i had the pleasure of talking for long with you so you believe monsieur that we shall gradually attain to a knowledge of all nature's secrets i am convinced of it but we should then be as powerful as the almighty not quite as knowing perhaps as powerful no do you think then that there is such a great distinction between knowledge and power there is an abyss between those two words god has given you authority to make use of all created things none of these things is useless or idle all at the right moment are capable of contributing to the well being of man to the happiness of humanity but in order to be able to apply these things to the good of the race and to the welfare of the individual man must know precisely the cause and the end of everything he will [utilise] {utilize} all and when he has [utilised] {utilized} the earth water fire and air neither space nor distance will any longer exist for him he will see the world as it is not merely in its visible forms but also in its invisible forms he will penetrate into the bowels of the earth as do gnomes he will inhabit water like nymphs and [tritons] {} he will play in fire as do hobgoblins and salamanders he will fly through the air like angels and sylphs he will ascend almost to god by the chain of being and by the ladder of perfection he will see the supreme ruler of all things as i see you and if instead of learning humility through knowledge he should gain pride if instead of [worshipping] {worshiping, worshiping} he be puffed up if because of his knowledge of creation he thinks himself equal to the creator god will say to him 'make me a star or a [rotifer] {} ' i thought i had not heard him correctly and i repeated a star or a or a [rotifer] {} it is an animal i have discovered [columbus] {} discovered a world and i an [ephemera] {ephemeral} do you imagine that [columbus] {} weighed heavier for all that before the eyes of god than i i remained in thought for a moment was this man out of his mind whether or no his madness was a fine frenzy well he went on one day people will discover water sprites gnomes sylphs nymphs angels just as i discovered my [animalcule] {} all that is needed is to find a microscope capable of perceiving the infinitely transparent just as we have discovered one for the infinitely little before the invention of the solar microscope creation to man's eyes stopped short at the [acarus] {} the [seison] {season} he little thought there were snakes in his water crocodiles in his vinegar blue dolphins in other things the solar microscope was invented and he saw them all i sat dumbfounded i had never heard anyone speak of such extraordinary things good gracious monsieur i said to him you open out to me a whole world of whose existence i knew nothing what are there serpents in water hydras crocodiles in our vinegar [ichthyosauri] {} and blue dolphins in but it is impossible ah that is the usual formula 'it is impossible ' you said just now 'it is impossible ' in reference to things we do not see and now you say 'it is [impossible'] {impossibles, impossible} of things that everybody else but yourself has seen all 'impossibility' is relative what is impossible to the oyster is not impossible to the fish what is impossible to the fish is not impossible to the serpent what is impossible to the serpent is not impossible to the quadruped what is impossible to the quadruped is not impossible to man what is impossible to man is not impossible with god when [fulton] {futon} offered to demonstrate the existence of steam to [napoleon] {} [napoleon] {} said as you 'it is impossible ' and had he lived two or three years longer he would have seen pass by from the top of his rocky island their funnels smoking the machines that might still have kept him emperor had he not scorned them as the creatures of a dream [utopian] {utopias, utopia} and impossible even job prophesied steamships job prophesied steamships yes most certainly what else do you think his description of leviathan meant whom he calls the king of the seas 'i will not forget the leviathan his strength and the [marvellous] {marvelous, marvelous} structure of his body by his [neesings] {} a light doth shine and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning out of his nostrils [goeth] {} smoke as out of a seething pot or [caldron] {cauldron} his breath [kindleth] {} coals his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstone he [maketh] {} the deep to boil as a pot he [maketh] {} the sea like a pot of ointment he [maketh] {} a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear ' leviathan is of course the modern steamship indeed monsieur i said to my [neighbour] {neighbor} you make my head reel you know so much and you talk so well i feel carried away by all you tell me like a leaf by a whirlwind you spoke of a tiny animal that you discovered an [ephemera] {ephemeral} do you call that a [rotifer] {} yes did you discover it in water in wine or in vinegar in wet sand how did it come about oh why in a very simple way i had begun making microscopic experiments upon infinitely small things long before [raspail] {} one day when i had examined under the microscope water wine vinegar cheese bread all the ingredients in fact that experiments are usually made upon i took a little wet sand out of my rain gutter i then lodged on a sixth floor i put it on the slide of my microscope and applied my eye to the lens then i saw a strange animal move about in shape like a [velocipede] {} furnished with two wheels which it moved very rapidly if it had a river to cross these wheels served the same purpose as those of a steamboat had it dry land to go over the wheels acted the same as those of a [tilbury] {} i watched it i studied its every detail i drew it then i suddenly remembered that my [rotifer] {} i had christened it by that name although i have since called it a [tarentatello] {} > i suddenly remembered that my [rotifer] {} had made me forget an engagement i was in a great hurry i had an appointment with one of the [animalculæ] {} which do not like being kept waiting an [ephemera] {ephemeral} whom mortals call a woman i left my microscope my [rotifer] {} and the pinch of sand which was his world i had other work to do where i went protracted and engaging work which kept me all the night i did not get back until the next morning i went straight to my microscope alas the sand had dried up during the night and my poor [rotifer] {} which needed moisture no doubt to live had died its almost imperceptible body was stretched on its left side its wheels were motionless the steamboat puffed no longer the [velocipede] {} had stopped ah poor [rotifer] {} i exclaimed wait wait ah was it like lord [ruthven] {} then he was not dead was he like lord [ruthven] {} a vampire you will see quite dead though he was the animal was still a curious variety of [ephemera] {ephemeral} and his body was as worth preserving as that of a mammoth or a mastodon only you understand quite other precautions have to be taken to handle an animal a hundred times smaller than a [seison] {season} than to change the situation of an animal ten times greater than an elephant i selected a little cardboard box from among all my boxes i destined it to be my [rotifer's] {} tomb and by the help of the feather end of a pen i transported my pinch of sand from the slide of my microscope to my box i meant to show this corpse to [geoffroy] {} saint [hilaire] {} or to [cuvier] {curvier} but i did not get the opportunity i never met these gentlemen or if i did meet them they declined to mount my six flights of stairs so for three or maybe six months or a year i forgot the body of the poor [rotifer] {} one day by chance the box fell into my hand and i desired to see what change a year had wrought on the body of an [ephemera] {ephemeral} the weather was cloudy there had been a great fall of stormy rain in order to see better i placed my microscope close to the window and i emptied the contents of the little box on to the slide the body of the poor [rotifer] {} still lay motionless on the sand but the weather which remembers the colossal so ruthlessly seemed to have forgotten the tiny atom i was looking at my [ephemera] {ephemeral} with an easily understood feeling of curiosity when suddenly the wind drove a drop of rain on to the microscope slide and wet my pinch of sand well i asked well then the miracle took place my [rotifer] {} seemed to revive at the touch of that refreshing coolness it began to move one antenna then another then one of its wheels began to turn round then both its wheels it regained its [centre] {} of gravity its movements became regular in short it lived nonsense monsieur the miracle of the resurrection in which perhaps you believe although [voltaire] {} had no faith in it was accomplished not at the end of three days three days a fine miracle but at the end of a year i renewed the same test ten times ten times the sand dried ten times the [rotifer] {} died ten times the sand was [wetted] {jetted, netted, petted, vetted, welted} and ten times the [rotifer] {} came to life again i had discovered an immortal not a [rotifer] {} monsieur my [rotifer] {} had probably lived before the deluge and would survive to the judgment day and you still possess this [marvellous] {marvelous, marvelous} animal ah monsieur my [neighbour] {neighbor} replied with a deep sigh i have not that happiness one day when for the twentieth time perhaps i was preparing to repeat my experiment a puff of wind carried away the dry sand and with the dry sand my deathless phenomenon alas i have taken many a pinch of wet sand from my gutters since and even from elsewhere but always in vain i have never found again the equivalent of what i lost my [rotifer] {} was not only immortal but even unique will you allow me to pass monsieur the second act is about to begin and i think this melodrama so poor that i much prefer to go away oh monsieur i said i beg of you not to go i have many more things to ask of you and you seem to me to be very learned you need not listen if you don't want to you can read [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [pastissier] {} [françois] {} and in the intervals we can talk of [elzevirs] {} and [rotifers] {} i will listen to the play which i assure you interests me greatly you are very good said my [neighbour] {neighbor} and he bowed then came the three raps and with the charming suavity i had already noticed in him he resumed his reading the curtain rose revealing the entrance to a farm a chain of snowy mountains and a window the farm represented on the stage was that belonging to [marsden] {} castle chapter

but still worse during the whole of the last scene he had played in a disturbing fashion with a key which he several times put to his lips really monsieur i said i think you are very hard on this piece my [neighbour] {neighbor} shrugged his shoulders yes monsieur i know it and the more so because the author considers himself a man of genius a man of talent the possessor of a good style but he deceives himself i saw the piece when it was played three years ago and now i have seen it again well what i said then i repeat the piece is dull unimaginative improbable yes see how he makes vampires act and then sir [aubrey] {} people don't talk of sir [aubrey] {} [aubrey] {} is a family name and the title of sir is only used before the baptismal name ah the author was wise to preserve his

' did you not say so i was not mistaken was i no well by employing such language you gave me the impression that you believe they really exist of course they exist have you ever seen any by chance

something to eat the son gave him all he wanted he ate it and then vanished the next day the son told me what had happened telling me he felt certain his father would not return once only and asking me to place myself the following night at a window to see him enter and go out i was very anxious to see a vampire i stood at the window but that night he did not come the son then told me fearing lest i should be discouraged that he would probably come on the following night on the following night i placed myself again at my window and sure enough towards midnight the old man appeared and i [recognised] {recognized} him perfectly he came from the direction of the cemetery he walked at a brisk pace but his steps made no sound when he reached the door he knocked i counted three raps the knocks sounded hard on the oak as though it were struck with a bone and not with a finger the son opened the door and the old man entered i listened to this story with the greatest attention and i began to prefer the intervals to the melodrama my curiosity was too highly excited for me to leave my window continued my [neighbour] {neighbor} there i stayed half an hour later the old man came out he returned whence he had come that is to say in the direction of the cemetery he disappeared round the corner of a wall at the same moment almost my door opened i turned round quickly and saw the son he was very pale 'well ' i said 'so your father came ' 'yes did you see him enter ' 'enter and come out what did he do to day ' 'he asked me for food and drink as he did the other day ' 'and did he eat and drink ' 'he ate and drank but that is not all this is what troubles me he said to me ' 'ah ' he said something else than a mere request for food and drink ' 'yes he said to me this is the second time i have come and eaten with thee it is now thy turn to come and eat with me ' 'the devil ' 'i am to expect him the same hour the day after to morrow ' 'the deuce you are ' 'yes yes that is just what worries me ' the day but one after he was found dead in his bed the same day two or three other people in the same village who had also seen the old man and to whom he had spoken fell ill and died too it was then [recognised] {recognized} that the old man was a vampire i was questioned i told all i had seen and heard justice demanded an examination of the graveyard they opened the tombs of all those who had died during the previous six weeks every corpse was in a state of decomposition but when they came to [kisilowa's] {} tomb that was the old man's name they found him with his eyes open his lips red his lungs breathing properly although he was as rigid as if in death they drove a stake through his heart he uttered a loud cry and blood gushed out from his mouth then they laid him on a stack of wood reduced him to ashes and scattered the ashes to the four winds i left the country soon after i never heard if his son turned into a vampire too why should he have become a vampire too i asked ah because it is the custom of those who die from a vampire's bite to become vampires really you say this as though it were a known fact but indeed it is a known registered and

death of a certain [heïduque] {} who lived in [medreiga] {} named [arnold] {} [paul] {haul, maul, pail, pall, pawl} who had been crushed by the fall of a hay [waggon] {wagon, wagon} four people died suddenly and from the nature of their death according to the traditions of the country it was evident that they had been the victims of [vampirism] {} they then called to mind that during his life

[turkish] {} vampire for they too hold the belief that those who have been passive vampires during their lives become active vampires after their death but that he had found a cure in the eating of earth from the vampire's grave and in rubbing himself with its blood precautions which did not prevent him from becoming a vampire after his death for four persons having died they thought the deed was due to him and they exhumed his body forty days after his burial he was quite [recognisable] {recognizable} and his body bore the [colour] {color} of life his hair his nails and his beard had grown his veins were filled with a bloody fluid which exuded from all parts of his body upon the shroud in which he was wrapped round the [hadnagi] {} or bailiff of the place in the presence of those who performed the act of exhumation and who was a man experienced in cases of [vampirism] {} caused a very sharp stake to be driven through the heart of the said [arnold] {} [paul] {haul, maul, pail, pall, pawl} after the usual custom piercing his body through and through a frightful cry escaping from his lips as though he were alive this act accomplished they cut off his head burned him to ashes and did the same with the corpses of the four or five other victims of [vampirism] {} lest they in their turn should cause the deaths of others but none of these precautions prevented the same wonders

and died in three [days'] {days} time since what she had said of the son of [millo] {mills, mill} led them to suspect him of being a vampire they exhumed him and found him in a state which left no doubt of the fact of [vampirism] {} they discovered in short after prolonged investigation that the defunct [arnold] {} [paul] {haul, maul, pail, pall, pawl} had not only killed the four persons already referred to but also many animals of which fresh vampires and particularly [millo's] {mill's} son had eaten on this evidence they decided to disinter all who had died since a certain date and

[rome] {come, dome, home, some, tome} certainly do you remember the name of the fifth of those emperors i think it was [nero] {hero, zero, nerd} right well [nero] {hero, zero, nerd} who poisoned his cousin [britannicus] {} [disembowelled] {disemboweled, disemboweled} his mother [agrippina] {} strangled his wife [octavia] {} killed his wife [poppæa] {poppa} with a kick in the stomach had a tenor

companions or before his courtesans at the [palatine] {} or [maison] {mason} [dorée] {} neither was it of much consequence when [nero] {hero, zero, nerd} sang as he watched [rome] {come, dome, home, some, tome} burn the [romans] {roans, roman} were too much occupied with the fire to pay any attention to a semi tone too high or a flat too low but when he took it into his head to sing in a public [theatre] {} it was a different matter every time the illustrious tenor deviated in the slightest degree from musical correctness some spectator allowed himself what i shall permit myself to do immediately if you insist on my remaining to the end of this silly melodrama to whistle of course the spectator was arrested and promptly flung to the lions but as he passed before [nero] {hero, zero, nerd} instead of saying simply according to custom 'augustus he who is about to die salutes thee ' he said 'augustus i am to die because you sang false but when i am dead you will not sing the more correctly ' this final salutation taken up and added to by other culprits annoyed [nero] {hero, zero, nerd} he had the whistlers strangled in the corridors and no one whistled any more but it was not enough for [nero] {hero, zero, nerd} that [hankerer] {hankered} after the impossible as [tacitus] {} called him it was not enough that no one whistled any more he wanted everybody to applaud him now

nobility no managers are not so hard to please in their choice and it is not necessary to show a gold ring on the first finger provided they can show a couple of big hands and bring these large hands rapidly and noisily together that is the only quartering of nobility required of them so you see i am quite right to warn you not to upset two of your friends for one of those rapscallions now that i have enlightened you will you allow me to leave i knew it would be impertinent to retain my [neighbour] {neighbor} any longer though his conversation which had covered a wide range of subjects in a short time was agreeable and highly edifying to myself it was evident he could not say the same of mine i could not teach him anything save that i was ignorant of everything he knew so i effaced myself with a sigh not daring to ask him who he was and allowing him to pass by with his [pastissier] {} [françois] {} hugged with both hands to his breast fearing no doubt lest one of the [chevaliers] {} of whom he had just spoken curious in the matter of rare books should relieve him of it i watched him withdraw with regret a vague presentiment told me that after having done me so

red cashmere shawls ornamented with a great gold flowered pattern my father had brought the shawls from [egypt] {} and i believe i have already referred to them we contented ourselves with sewing them together leaving an opening on each side for my arms a sword belt at the waist serving as a girdle out of each arm hole appeared a satin sleeve and don [ramire] {} was if not exactly sufficiently at least [sumptuously] {} and modestly clad from the shoulders to half way down his thighs a turned down collar and a satin toque to match the tunic in [colour] {color} completed the upper part of the costume but the question of the lower half was more serious tights were rare in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i might even say that they were unknown so it was of no use wishing to procure tights it would have been time wasted a vision a dream the longest pair of silk stockings that could be found sewed into a pair of drawers did the business then came the laced boots ah these laced boots they were an invention of my own a second pair of silk stockings were dyed red soles were sewed to them they were put over the first pair then turned back rolled up to within three inches of the ankle the roll was tied fast to make a pad we imitated the lacing of a laced boot with green ribbon and then this [footgear] {footwear} formed the base of a presentable

over her grave a literary monument in my writings a sepulchral monument in stone the stones were to be paid for by my literary [labours] {labors} and it pleased me to think of being the architect of

is never solved until after their death i never learned [dorval's] {} age until she died she was born on twelfth night in the year 1798 so in 1823 when i was twenty she was twenty five she did not call herself [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [dorval] {dorsal} then those two names so easy to pronounce that they seem always to have belonged to her were not then linked to each other by the golden chain of genius her real name was [thomase] {} [amélie] {} [delaunay] {} she was born close to the [théâtre] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [lorient] {orient} and her earliest steps were patters across

also her first sorrows her mother fell ill of a long and painful disease the engagements which madame [delaunay] {} found as first singer became fewer as her voice grew weaker then the young girl redoubled her [labours] {labors} she knew that talent was not only a question of art but still more one of necessity thanks to her efforts her engagements brought in eighty francs to a hundred francs and those of [her'] {herb, herd, here, hero, hers} mother diminished at the same time from three hundred francs to one hundred and fifty francs and from one hundred and fifty francs they fell to nothing from that time began the young girl's life of devotion which continued on into womanhood for a year [amélie] {} [delaunay] {} did everything for her mother she was servant nurse comforter then at the end of a year the mother died and all those nights of watching and weeping all her careful [tendings] {endings, tending} were lost except in the sight of god when her mother died the young girl

the vampire at which my [neighbour] {neighbor} had hooted so shamelessly poor [marie] {maria, mare, marine} only she herself could relate the sufferings of those early days there was i remember one

[xviii] {} on the 18th they brought his body to the church of saint [laurent] {} his own parish church but the clergy refused to take it in the same thing happened with regard to mademoiselle

the hearse six actors from the different [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} [theatres] {} bore it on their shoulders and followed by over three thousand people they took it to the [tuileries] {} they meant to deposit the coffin in the castle courtyard to demand justice and not to withdraw until they had received it the resolution was all the more impressive as it was accomplished with composure and solemnity the [cortège] {cortege} was moving along the boulevards and had reached the top of the rue [montmartre] {} when a squadron of police rushed out at full gallop swords in hand and barred the entire width of the boulevard then a council of deliberation was held over the bier and still with the same calmness and the same composure a deputation of five was elected to go to the [tuileries] {} and to ask for the prayers of the church and a [christian] {} burial for the body of poor [philippe] {} these five deputies were mm Étienne [jourdan] {} [colombeau] {} [ménessier] {}

[corbières] {} very brutal by nature replied roughly that the clergy had their laws that it was not his business to transgress them although he was in charge of the police of the realm the five deputies brought back this reply to the three thousand [parisians] {} camped in the boulevard round the coffin that was craving burial the bearers then took the body up again on their shoulders and pursued their course with it along the road to [père] {pare, pore, pure, pyre} [lachaise] {} victory remained on the side of authority as the saying is only it is by such kinds of victories that authority cuts its own throat another victory like that said [pyrrhus] {} after the battle of [heracles] {} and we shall be lost from that moment the generous promises made by [charles] {charges} x on

was my [neighbour] {neighbor} the [bibliomaniac] {} and whistler the next day i waited from eight o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock but as my [neighbour] {neighbor} in the orchestra had predicted nobody came to demand satisfaction for the blow i had dealt on the previous evening however i had now arrived at two convictions namely that there must be something extravagant about my appearance and about some portion of my clothing for fear of falling out egregiously with everybody i met abroad i ought to cut my locks and to shorten the length of my coat my hair was fully two inches too long my coat certainly a foot beyond regulation length i called in a barber and a tailor the barber asked me for ten minutes the tailor for a day i gave up my coat to the tailor and my head to the barber i intended to go to the office in a morning coat it should be understood that my first visit to the office was almost in the nature of a call upon my chiefs a morning coat would not be out of place my face was completely changed by the cropping of my hair when it was too long i looked like one of the sellers of lion pomade who make their own heads their principal prospectuses when my hair was too short i looked like a seal of course the barber cut my hair too short unfortunately there was then no remedy left me but to wait until it grew again when i had breakfasted fairly well at my hotel and given notice that i should settle my account and leave the establishment that evening i made my way towards the office as a quarter past ten struck i made inquiries of the porter in the hall and he told me which staircase led to m [oudard's] {} offices otherwise the secretariat they were situated at the right angle of the second court of the [palais] {} royal looking upon the square from the side of the garden i went towards this staircase and i furnished myself with fresh instructions from a second porter the offices were on the third floor so i climbed up my heart was beating violently i was entering upon another life one which i had desired and chosen for myself this time this staircase was leading me to my future office where would my future office lead me no one had arrived i waited with the office boys the first [employé] {employs, employ} who appeared was a fine big fair youth he came singing up the stairs and took down the office door key from a nail i rose monsieur [ernest] {earnest} said one of the office boys the eldest of them a lad called [raulot] {} this young man wants to speak to m [oudard] {} the person addressed as [ernest] {earnest} looked at me for a moment with his keen clear blue eyes monsieur i said to him i am one of the supernumeraries of whom you may perhaps have heard ah yes m [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} he exclaimed the son of general [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} recommended by general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} i saw he knew all about me i am the same i said come in he said going in before me and opening the door of a small room with one window in it and three desks see he continued you are expected here is your seat everything is ready paper pens ink you have but to sit down and to draw up your chair to your desk have i the pleasure of talking to one of those with whom i am destined to spend my days i asked yes i have just been promoted as ordinary clerk at eighteen hundred francs i am giving up my place as copying clerk and that place will be yours after a longer or shorter probationary period and who is our third companion he is our deputy head clerk [lassagne] {} the door opened [hullo] {hello, hulls, hull} who is talking about [lassagne] {} asked a young man of twenty eight to thirty as he came in [ernest] {earnest} turned round ah it is you he replied i was just saying to m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} he pointed to me i bowed i was just telling m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} that this was your place that his and the other mine are you our new colleague [lassagne] {} asked me yes monsieur you are welcome and he held out his hand to me i took it it was one of those warm and trembling hands that it is a pleasure to shake from the first touch a loyal hand revealing the nature of him to whom it belonged good i said to myself this man will be friendly to me i am sure listen he said a word of advice it is [rumoured] {rumored} that you have come here with the idea of entering upon a literary career do not talk too loudly of such a project it will only do you harm hush that is [oudard] {} entering his room and i heard in the [neighbouring] {neighboring} room the self possessed measured tread of a man accustomed to rule an office a moment later the door of our office opened and [raulot] {} appeared m [oudard] {} wants m [alexandre] {} [dumas] {pumas, dumps} he said i rose and cast a glance at [lassagne] {} he understood what i felt like go along he said he is a capital fellow but you have to become acquainted with him however you will soon do that this was not altogether reassuring so it was with my heart beating very rapidly that i proceeded along the corridor and entered m [oudard's] {} office i found him standing before the fireplace he was a man of five feet six inches high with a brown complexion black hair and an impassive face gentle although firm his black eyes had that direct look to be found in men who have risen from a lower class to a high position its expression was almost stonily hard when it was fixed on you you would have said he had ridden rough shod over everything and everybody that had come in his way as so many obstacles on the road towards that goal known only to himself which he had made up his mind to reach he had fine teeth but contrary to the habit of those who possess this advantage he rarely smiled one could see that nothing not even the most insignificant event was indifferent to him a pebble under the foot of an ambitious man will raise him higher by the size of that pebble [oudard] {} was very ambitious but as he was also essentially honest i doubt whether his ambition had ever i will not say inspired him with an evil thought what man is master of his thoughts but caused him to commit a mean action later it will be seen that he was hard on me almost pitiless he was i am sure well [intentioned] {} in being so he did not think of the future i wanted to carve for myself and he feared i should only lose the position i had made the position which he had helped me to make [oudard] {} unlike other upstarts (and let us admit he was really more a man who had achieved success than a mere [parvenu)] {parvenus, parvenu} talked a great deal of the village where he was born of the home in which he had been brought up of his old mother who came to see him dressed in her peasant's costume with whom he would walk out in the [palais] {} royal or whom he would take to the play just as she was perhaps all this talk was only another form of pride but it is a pride i like he was devoted to his mother a sentiment sufficiently rare in ambitious men to be noted here as out of the common [oudard] {} must have been thirty two at that period he was head of the secretarial department and private secretary to the [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [d'orléans] {} these two posts combined must have been worth about twelve thousand francs a year to him perquisites included he was clad in black trousers a white [piqué] {pique} waistcoat and a black coat and cravat he wore very fine cotton stockings and slippers such was the get up of a man who was not merely chief clerk of an office but one who might be called into the presence of a prince or princess at any moment come in monsieur [dumas] {pumas, dumps} he said i went up to him and bowed you have been very especially commended to me by two persons one of whom i greatly respect and the other of whom i love dearly is not general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} one of these monsieur yes he is the man i respect but how is it you do not guess the name of the other i confess monsieur i should be puzzled to name anyone else in whom i can have inspired sufficient interest to cause him to take the trouble to recommend me to you it was m [deviolaine] {} m [deviolaine] {} i repeated in considerable surprise yes m [deviolaine] {} is he not related to you certainly monsieur but when my mother begged m [deviolaine] {} to have the goodness to recommend me to [monseigneur] {} [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} m [deviolaine] {} met the request so coldly oh you know brusqueness is almost the leading trait in the character of our worthy conservator you must not pay any heed to that i fear monsieur that if my good cousin spoke much of me to you in recommending me to you he has not flattered me that would not be bad for you since it would but give you a chance to surprise me agreeably he has probably told you i was idle he told me you had never done much work but you are young and you can make up for lost time he told you i cared for nothing but shooting he confessed you were something of a poacher he told you i was wayward and changeable in my ideas and fancies he said you had been under all the solicitors in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and [crespy] {crispy, creepy} and had not been able to stop with any of them he exaggerated somewhat but if i did not remain with either of the two solicitors under whom i worked it was on account of my unalterable intense desire to come to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} very well here you are and your desire is fulfilled was that all m [deviolaine] {} told you about me well no he said too that you were a good son and that although you constantly made your mother miserable you adored her that you had never really wished to learn anything but more from over quickness than from want of intelligence he told me besides that you had certainly a poor head but that he also believed you were good [hearted] {hearten, heated} go and thank him go and thank him where shall i find him one of the office boys will take you to him he rang take m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} to m [deviolaine's] {} rooms he said then addressing me you have already met [lassagne] {} he said yes i have just had five [minutes'] {minutest, minutes} talk with him he is a very good fellow with but one failing he will be too weak with you luckily i shall be at hand [lassagne] {} and [ernest] {earnest} [basset] {basket, basses, asset} will tell you what your work will be and m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} i asked m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} was the general manager m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} will be told you have come and will probably ask for you you know that your whole future depends on him and on you monsieur yes i hope so far as i am concerned that that will not cause you much uneasiness but go and thank m [deviolaine] {} go you have already delayed too long i bowed to m [oudard] {} and i went out five minutes afterwards i was at m [deviolaine's] {} he worked in a large room by himself and at a desk which stood alone in the middle of the room as i was preceded by an office boy and as it was presumed that i had been sent by m [oudard] {} they let me enter unannounced m [deviolaine] {} heard the door open and he waited an instant for someone to speak then as i also was waiting he looked up and asked who is there it is i m [deviolaine] {} who you ( [toi] {poi, toe, tog, tom, ton} ) i see you [recognise] {recognize} me by the way you speak yes i [recognise] {recognize} you so there you are well you are a fine lad why if you please well you have been to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} three times without paying me a single call i did not know you would care to see me it was not for you to question whether it would please me or not it was your duty to come well here i am better late than never what have you come for now i have come to thank you what for for what you said about me to m [oudard] {} you are not difficult to please then why do you know what i did say certainly you told him i was an idle lad that i was no good except for copying deeds that i had tired out the patience of every solicitor in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} and in [crespy] {crispy, creepy} well is there much thanks due to me for all that no it was not for that i came to thank you it was for what you added i did not add anything but you did you went on to say i tell you i added nothing but i will add something now you are here that is that if you are so ill advised as to write filthy plays and trashy verses here as you did in [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} i will report you i will carry you off with me i will confine you in one of my offices and i will lead you a dog's life see if i don't let me say cousin what while i am here well even if you do not let me go back well because that a cause [que] {cue, due, hue, rue, sue} a grammatical error i know quite well but [corneille] {} and [bossuet] {} made use of it because that i have only come to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} to write filthy plays and trashy verses whether i am in the secretarial department or here i must still continue to write them ah is that so do you seriously imagine you can become a [corneille] {} a [racine] {rapine, ravine, racing} or a [voltaire] {} after an education of three francs a month if i were to become such a man as any one of those three i should be only what another man has been and that would not be worth while you mean then that you would do better than they i would do something different come a little nearer me so that i can give you a good kick you conceited lad i went nearer to him here i am i believe the impudent boy has actually come closer yes my mother told me to give you her love is your poor mother quite well i hope she is she is a good creature how the devil did you happen to come into the world by such a mother come shake hands and be off with you good bye cousin he kept hold of my hand do you want any money you rogue thanks i have some where did you get it i will tell you that some other time it would take too long now you are right i have no time to lose be off with you good bye cousin come and dine with me when you like oh thanks yes for your people to look down on me to look down on you i would like to see them do that my wife dined often enough with your grandfather and your grandmother to justify you in coming to dine with me as often as you like but now be off cub you are making me waste all my time m [deviolaine's] {} office boy came in his name was [féresse] {} we shall see more of him later m

finished no not yet in a quarter of an hour then turning to me you see you see i will make myself scarce m [deviolaine] {} and off i went while m [deviolaine] {} buried his nose in the report growling as usual i returned to our common office and i sat down at my desk my desk was next to [lassagne's] {} so we were only separated from one another by the width of our tables and by the little black set of pigeon holes in which the current work was usually put [ernest] {earnest} had gone out i know not why i asked [lassagne] {} to tell me what to do [lassagne] {} got up [leant] {meant, least, leans, lent, lean} over my desk and told me i always took a great interest in studying people around me and especially the man whose position in the office was that of my immediate superior for although [ernest] {earnest} was now a full fledged clerk and i only destined to be a simple copying clerk he was more my comrade than my superior [lassagne] {} as i think i have already said was at that time a man of twenty eight or thirty with an attractive face enshrined in beautiful black hair animated by black eyes full of intelligence and cleverness and lighted up (if the phrase may be [permitted)] {permitted} by teeth so white and so regular that the vainest of women might have envied them the only defect in his face was his aquiline nose which was a little more inclined to one side than the other but this very irregularity gave an original touch to his face that it would not have had without it add to these things a sympathetic voice which seemed gently to vibrate in one's ear and at the sound of which it was impossible not to turn round and smile in short a delightful person whose like i have rarely met well informed a brilliant song writer the intimate friend of [désaugiers] {} [théaulon] {} [armand] {armband} [gouffé] {} brazier [rougemont] {} and all the opera writers of the time so that he refreshed himself after his official work which he loathed by entering into the literary world which he adored and his daily [labour] {labor} alternated with desultory work consisting partly of articles for the [drapeau] {} [blanc] {bland, blank, blanch} and the [foudre] {} and partly of contributions to some of the most delightful plays of the operatic [theatres] {} it will be admitted that here was the very superior i needed and i could not have asked providence for anything that would have seemed to me better for me well during the five years that we spent in the same office there was never a cloud or a quarrel or a feeling of cross purposes between [lassagne] {} and me he made me like the hour at which i began my daily work because i knew he would come in immediately after me he made me love the time i spent at my desk because he was always ready there to help me with an explanation to teach me something fresh about life which had as yet for me scarcely opened about the world of which i was totally ignorant and finally about foreign or national literature of which in 1823 i knew practically nothing either of the one or of the other [lassagne] {} arranged my daily work it was entirely mechanical and consisted in copying out in the finest handwriting possible the largest possible number of letters these according to their importance had to be signed by m [oudard] {} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} or even by the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} in the midst of this correspondence which concerned the whole range of administration and which often when addressed to princes or foreign kings passed from matters of administration to politics there occurred reports connected with the contentious affairs of m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} for the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} himself prepared his litigious business for his counsel doing himself the work that solicitors do for barristers that is to say preparing the briefs these were nearly always entirely in the handwriting of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} or at all events corrected and annotated in his large thick writing in which every letter was fastened to its [neighbouring] {neighboring} letter by a solid stroke after the fashion of the arguments of a logical [dialectician] {} bound together entwined succeeding each other i was attacking my first letter and by the advice of [lassagne] {} who had laid great stress on this point i was [despatching] {dispatching} it in my very best handwriting when i heard the door of communication between [oudard's] {} office and ours open i pretended with the hypocrisy of an old hand to be so deeply absorbed in my work that no noise could distract my attention when i heard the creak of steps advancing towards my desk and then they stopped by me [dumas] {pumas, dumps} called out [lassagne] {} to me i raised my head and i saw standing close to me on my left a person who was totally unknown to me m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} added [lassagne] {} adding information to his exclamation i rose from my seat do not disturb yourself he said and he took the letter i was copying which was nearly finished and read it i took advantage of this respite to examine him m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} as everyone knows had been one of the faithful followers of m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} he had never left him during the last portion of his exile serving him sometimes as secretary at other times as [diplomatist] {} in this latter capacity he had been mixed up in all the lengthy discussions over the marriage of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} with princess [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [amélie] {} daughter of [ferdinand] {} and [caroline] {caroling} king and queen of [naples] {maples, napes} and in connection with this marriage he had gained the order of saint [janvier] {} which he wore on a braided coat on high festivals next to the cross of the legion of [honour] {honor} he was a little old man of about sixty years of age with short stubbly hair he was slightly lame walked crookedly on his left side had a big red nose which told its own tale and small [grey] {prey, gray, grew} eyes that expressed nothing he looked a typical courtier polite obsequious fawning to his master kind by fits and starts but generally capricious with his subordinates he thought a great deal of trifles attaching supreme importance to the manner in which a letter was folded or a seal was fastened he really imbibed these notions from the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} himself who was even more particular over little details than perhaps was m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} read the letter took my pen added an apostrophe or a comma here and there then replacing it in front of me finish it he said i finished it he waited behind me literally pressing on my shoulders every fresh face i saw in turn had its effect on me i finished with a very shaky hand there it is m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} i said good he exclaimed he took a pen signed threw sand over my writing and over his then giving me back the epistle which was for a simple inspector as at first they did not risk confiding more than that to my inexperienced hand he said do you know how to fold a letter i looked at him with astonishment i ask you if you know how to fold a letter answer me yes yes at least i believe so i replied astonished at the fixed stare his little [grey] {prey, gray, grew} eyes had assumed you believe is that all you are not sure monsieur i am not yet sure about anything as you see not even about the folding of a letter and there you are right for there are ten ways of folding a letter according to the rank of the person to whom it is addressed fold this one i began to fold the letter in four oh what are you about he said i stopped short pardon monsieur i said but you ordered me to fold the letter and i am folding it m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} bit his lip i had laid emphasis on the word ordered in the spoken phrase as i have just underlined it in the written phrase yes he said but you are folding it square that is all right for high functionaries if you give square folded letters to inspectors and sub inspectors what will you do for ministers princes and kings quite so m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} i replied will you tell me what is the correct way for inspectors and sub inspectors oblong monsieur oblong you will pardon my ignorance monsieur i know what an oblong is in theory but i do not yet know what it is in practice see and m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} condescended willingly to give me the lesson in things oblong i had asked of him there he said when the letter was folded thank you monsieur i replied now monsieur the envelope he said i had never made envelopes except for the rare petitions i had written for my mother and once on my own account in general [foy's] {boy's, joy's, soy's, toy's, fly's} office so i was still more ignorant about the making of envelopes than about the folding i took a half sheet of paper in my left hand a pair of scissors in my right hand and i began to cut the sheet m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} uttered a mingled cry of surprise and terror oh good lord he said what are you going to do why m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} i am going to make the envelope you asked me to make with scissors yes first learn this monsieur paper should not be cut it should be torn i listened with all attention oh i exclaimed it should be torn repeated m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} and then in this case there is no need even to tear the paper which perhaps you do not [realise] {realize, realism, realist} either no monsieur i do not you will learn it only wants an [english] {} envelope ah an [english] {} envelope you do not know how to make an [english] {} envelope i do not even know what it is m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} i will show you as a general rule monsieur square letters and square envelopes are for ministers for princes and for kings right m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} i will remember you are sure yes good and for heads of departments chief assistants inspectors and sub inspectors oblong letters and [english] {} envelopes i repeated oblong letters and [english] {} envelopes yes yes of course there that is what we call an [english] {} envelope thank you monsieur now the seal [ernest] {earnest} will you light me a taper [ernest] {earnest} hastened to bring us the lighted taper and now i confess to my shame my confusion increased i had never hitherto sealed my letters except with wafers that is to say when i had sealed them i took the wax in so awkward a fashion i heated it in such a queer way i blew it out so quickly for fear of burning the paper that this time i excited pity rather than impatience in the breast of m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} oh my friend he said have you really never even sealed a letter never monsieur i replied who was there for me to write to buried away as i have been in a little country town this humble confession touched m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} see he said heating the wax this is how one seals a letter and believe me he sealed the letter at arm's length with as steady a hand as though he had been twenty five years of age then taking a large silver seal he pressed it on the lake of burning wax and did not withdraw it until the impress was clearly defined and i could see the escutcheon with the three heraldic [fleurs] {flours} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [lis] {dis, his, pis, sis, lbs} of [orléans] {} surmounted by the ducal coronet i was disheartened i must confess write the address m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} said imperiously i wrote the address with a trembling hand good good said m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [chevalier] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} don't be discouraged my boy it is all right now countersign it i stopped completely ignorant of what a countersign was m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} began to [realise] {realize, realism, realist} as general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} had done how ignorant i was he pointed with a finger to the corner of the letter there he said write there [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} that is to frank the letter you hear i heard well enough but i was so profoundly upset that i hardly understood what was said there said m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval] {} taking up the letter and looking at it with a satisfied air that is all right but you must learn all these things [ernest] {earnest} [ernest] {earnest} was m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [broval's] {} [favourite] {favorite} and in his genial moments the old courtier called him by his [christian] {} name [ernest] {earnest} teach m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} to fold letters to make envelopes and to seal packets and at these words he took himself off the door had scarcely shut before i was begging my comrade [ernest] {earnest} to begin his lessons and he gave himself up to the task at once with hearty goodwill [ernest] {earnest} was a first rate hand at folding making envelopes and sealing but i put my whole will into it and it was not long before i [equalled] {squalled, equaled, equaled} and surpassed my master's skill when i gave in my resignation in 1831 to the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} who had become [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} i i had attained to such perfection in the third accomplishment especially that the only regret he expressed was this the devil that is a pity you are the best sealer of letters i have ever seen while i was taking my lesson in folding and sealing under [ernest] {earnest} [lassagne] {} was reading the papers oh he suddenly exclaimed i well recollect that what is it i asked instead of answering me [lassagne] {} read aloud a scene which recalls that of la [fontaine] {} at the first representation of [florentin] {} took place yesterday evening at the third performance of the revival of the vampire our learned bibliophile [charles] {charges} [nodier] {nosier} was expelled from [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint martin [theatre] {} for disturbing the play by whistling [charles] {charges} [nodier] {nosier} is one of the anonymous authors of the vampire so i cried my [neighbour] {neighbor} of the orchestra was [charles] {charges} [nodier] {nosier} did you have any talk with him asked [lassagne] {} i did nothing else during the intervals you were fortunate continued [lassagne] {} had i been in your place i should have greatly preferred the intervals to the play i knew [charles] {charges} [nodier] {nosier} by name but i was in complete ignorance as to what he had done as i left the office i entered a bookshop and asked for a novel by [nodier] {nosier} they gave me [jean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} [sbogar] {} the reading of that book began to shake my faith in [pigault] {} [lebrun] {} chapter [ii] {hi, mi, pi, ti, id} illustrious contemporaries the

hatreds jealousies of a life that has been harassed in its minor details but ever calm and serene in its progress i reached the position god had assigned me i attained it without the aid of intrigues or cliques and advanced only by my own [endeavours] {endeavors} i have reached the summit which every man mounts half way through life and i ask for nothing i desire nothing i covet nothing i have many friendships i have not a single enmity if at the starting point of my life god had said to me young man what do you desire i should not have dared to demand from his infinite greatness that which he has condescended to grant me out of his fatherly goodness so i will say all i have to say of the men i have named according as they have appeared to me on my path through life if i conceal anything

poets i therefore leave them out of the question they have not done theatrical work and i do not know if they are likely to though if they ever do i doubt whether they would succeed why not because

you ask me more than i can tell you the public has not made up its mind it knows already what it does not want any longer but it does not yet know what it wants in poetry in drama or in fiction in

[casimir] {} [delavigne] {} ah he is different [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} is the poet of the people we must leave him his circle he does not enter into competition well in comedy tragedy drama whom

do not attempt to produce either comedy or tragedy or drama take passions events characters smelt them all down in the furnace of your imagination and raise statues of [corinthian] {} bronze what is [corinthian] {} bronze don't you know i know nothing what a happy state to be in why because then you can find things out for yourself you need only measure things by the standard of your own

somewhere in the [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [viris] {virus, iris} then you will remember that the heat of the fire melted the gold silver and brass which ran down the streets in streams now the

observer like [walter] {falter, halter, salter, welter, waiter} [scott] {scoot, scout} clever at description like cooper with the addition of a touch of passion ah such a man would be almost perfect

years oh longer than that or you will write ignorantly oh my god what a lot of time i have lost you must retrieve it you will aid me will you not what about the office oh i will read and study at night i will work at the office and we can have a chat from time to time yes like to day's but we have talked too much one word more you have told me what i ought to study in the drama yes in romance

because you would not be a friend of his for long you think not i am certain of it thanks i will keep my mouth shut you will do well now a second word of advice i am listening you must not repeat a

it depends on yourself oh if it depends on me we shall be together for many years so be it at this point m [oudard] {} entered and i set to my task with an avidity that won me many compliments from

me to the end i was trying to reach how was it [adolphe] {} had never spoken to me of all these matters so far reaching were the vistas that opened before me every moment that i was bewildered did [adolphe] {} think all this of little use in connection with the art and practice of literature or was it that the kind of literature he wanted me to produce could dispense with all such knowledge i had often noticed his father shrug his shoulders at our theatrical schemes was it not perchance that his father who knew so many things laughed in his sleeve at me for being so ignorant and m [deviolaine] {} who instinctively (for except as a [valuer] {vaguer, valued, values, value} and in questions of forestry he hardly knew more than i [did)] {did} called my attempts filth and my efforts

[delavigne] {} at the reading of the [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} at the [théâtre] {} [français] {} yes the piece was refused not merely was the piece refused but as every voter is obliged to give a

had so many new parts she could not possibly undertake ours the devil take it it would seem that actresses do not need to study so hard as authors ah my dear friend why did you not tell me of my ignorance and that i have everything to learn don't put yourself out about that dear fellow you will soon learn all you need stay my mother is beckoning to us to come let us go in to dinner we went in and i was introduced to madame [arnault] {} i was already acquainted with [lucien] {} [telleville] {} and [louis] {louts} i had seen m [arnault] {} at the famous shooting expedition in [tillet]

{} had said the deer could not fail to pass by m [arnault] {} who could not see two gun lengths off had wiped the glasses of his spectacles sat down produced a memorandum book and a pencil and began to write a fable that had been running in his head since the previous day in a quarter of an hour he heard a noise in the [underwood] {} he laid down his pocket book and pencil took up his gun and pointed it ready for action as soon as the animal should pass by oh monsieur a woman cried out don't shoot you will kill my cow are you quite sure it is your cow and not a roebuck m [arnault] {} then asked her oh monsieur you will see and the woman running up to the cow hung on the animal's tail which she pulled so hard that the poor beast began to moo you are right said m [arnault] {} i think i

refusal at the [gymnase] {gymnast} for he looked upon the acceptance on condition of alteration as a refusal i shall often return to and speak much of [soulié] {} he was one of the most powerful literary influences of the day and his personality was one of the most marked i have known he died young he died not only in the full tide of his talent but even before he had produced the perfect and finished work he would certainly have created some day or other had not death hastened its footsteps [soulié's] {} brain was a little confused and obscure his thoughts were only lighted up on one side after the fashion of this planet the reverse side to the one illuminated by the sun was pitifully dark [soulié] {} did not know how to begin either a novel or a drama the opening explanation of his work was done [hap] {cap, gap, lap, map, nap} hazard sometimes in the first act sometimes in the last if it were a play if it were a novel sometimes in the first sometimes in the last volume his introduction timidly begun nearly always was laboriously [unravelled] {unraveled, unraveled} it seemed as though like those night birds which need the darkness to develop all their faculties [soulié] {} was not at ease save in twilight i was for ever [quarrelling] {quarreling, quarreling} with him on this point as he was gifted with [unrivalled] {unrivaled, unrivaled} imagination and power when he was on the warpath i used to beseech him continually to let in the utmost possible daylight at the beginning of his action be clear to the verge of transparency i continually said to him god's greatness consists in his making of light without light we should not have known how to appreciate the sublime grandeur of creation [soulié] {} was twenty six when i first knew him he was a lusty young man of medium height but [capitally] {} proportioned he had a prominent forehead dark hair eyebrows and beard a well shaped nose and full eyes thick lips and white teeth he laughed readily although it was never a fresh young laugh it sounded ironical and strident which gave it the quality of age being naturally of a bantering disposition irony was a weapon he could wield admirably he had tried his hand at most things and he retained some slight knowledge of everything he had done after having received an excellent education in the provinces i believe he studied law at [rheims] {} to which we owe the admirable description of student's life in his book entitled confession [générale] {} he passed his legal examinations and was called to the bar but he did not take kindly to the profession rather than follow that very liberal avocation he preferred a mercantile calling this aversion led to his developing the notion of a big steam sawmill in 1824 or 1825 in the meantime [soulié] {} (who then signed himself [soulié] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [lavelanet)] {} lived upon a small allowance his father made him a hundred [louis] {louts} as far as i am able to remember he lived in the rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [provence] {province} on the first floor in a bewitching room that seemed a palace to us there was above all else a most unwonted luxury in this room a piano on which [soulié] {} could play two or three tunes he was both very radical and very aristocratic two qualities which often went together at that period see for example carrel whom we have already seen in the [béfort] {} affair and who will reappear on the scene presently after the amnesty to be accorded by [charles] {charges} x on his accession to the throne [soulié] {} was brave without being quarrelsome but he had the sensitiveness both of the student and of the southerner he was passably [skilful] {skillful, skillful} as a swordsman and a first rate shot [soulié] {} at first thought me a worthless lad of no importance and it was quite natural he should he was astonished and almost overwhelmed by my early successes by that time i knew [soulié] {} as he was jealous almost to envy but by reason of the strong kindliness of his good and upright heart able to keep all the evil tendencies of his character under control a constant struggle was waged within him between good and bad principles and yet not once perhaps did the evil principle get the better of him he very often tried to hate me but never managed to succeed very often when he set out to run me down in conversation he would end by praising me and as a matter of fact i was the man who hampered his career more than any other in the [theatre] {} in the newspapers in the matter of books i was everywhere in his path doing him involuntary but actual damage everywhere and in spite of this i was so certain of [soulié] {} and so sure of his supreme justice and goodness of heart that if i had needed any act of service i should have gone to [soulié] {} to ask it of him rather than of any other and he would have rendered me this service more readily than any other person would at first [soulié] {} turned his attention towards poetry it was in the domain of poetry i believe that he looked to make his conquests his first stage play was an imitation of [shakespeare's] {} [romeo] {rodeo} and [juliet] {} i never experienced greater emotion than that which i felt at the first representation of this play we were often months or a year without seeing each other but when fate turned us face to face no matter how far off we might be we each walked straight to the [other's] {ether's, ocher's, otter's, others, bother's} heart and open arms perhaps before catching sight of me [soulié] {} had not particularly cared to meet me perhaps had someone told him [dumas] {pumas, dumps} is over there he would have made a detour but directly he caught sight of me the electric current dominated his will and he was mine body and soul as though never a single jealous thought had crossed his mind it was different with regard to [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} or [lamartine] {} he did not like them and he rarely spoke impartially of their talent i feel convinced that it was [hugo's] {hug's} odes [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [ballades] {ballads} and [lamartine's] {} [m&ditations] {meditations} which led [frédéric] {} [soulié] {} to write in prose rest in peace friend of my youth companion of my first serious efforts i will depict thee as thou [wert] {pert, wart, weft, welt, went} i will design a statue of thee not a bust i will isolate thee i will place thee on the pedestal of thy works so that all those who never knew thee may take the measure of thy impressive figure for thou art one of those who can be studied from all aspects and who living or dead have no need to be afraid of being placed in a full light at the time of which i am writing [soulié] {} was linked in literary friendship with [jules] {mules, rules, julep, joules, juleps} [lefèvre] {} and [latouche] {} [latouche] {} with whom he [quarrelled] {quarreled, quarreled} so fiercely later over [christine] {} in private life his chief friend was a tall stout fellow called [david] {davit, avid} who was at that time and may still be a stockbroker i do not know whether [soulié] {} was his only friend but i believe that on the exchange he made not a few enemies when we went to see [soulié] {} he was entertaining a dozen of his friends to tea cake and sandwiches such luxuries quite dazzled me [soulié] {} was conscious of his own powers and this rendered him extremely scornful towards second rate literature in his efforts to poach upon other [writers'] {writers} preserves until the time came when he could do better than they he treated certain contemporary celebrities whose positions i envied greatly with lofty off handedness he proposed he said to publish an almanac for the coming year 1824 entitled the parfait [vaudevilliste] {} which should consist of ready made verses from old soldiers and young colonels among these verses from old soldiers were some of the first order and the following may be taken as a model it is one which [gontier] {goutier} sang in [michel] {} [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [christine] {} and for which he was enthusiastically applauded nightly sans

representation a certain number of choruses applicable to current events and these found a fitting place in the parfait [vaudevilliste] {} unfortunately i did not copy any of them at [soulié's] {} at that period three or four months before his death i begged him to send me his collection he had lost it instead he sent me five or six of the choruses he remembered only he could not tell me exactly to what period they belonged he could only affirm that they were not bastard waifs and strays as might readily be believed but acknowledged and legitimate offspring and by way of proof he sent along with them the names of their [begetters] {} these choruses were of course the author's exclusive property he placed them in identical situations some of them had already done duty ten twenty thirty times and only waited the opportunity to be used a thirty first time we will begin with a chorus from the [barbier] {barrier, babier, barber} [châtelain] {} by [théaulon] {} to every man his due

became proverbial directly the scene began everyone commenced to hum in advance the chorus which came at the end of it another chorus of brazier and [courcy] {} in the [parisien] {} à [londres] {} was also not devoid of merit unluckily the scene it belonged to was so peculiar that it was only used once nevertheless it remained in the memories of a fair number of connoisseurs it was about a [frenchman] {} who was surprised during a criminal amour and who when led before his judges excited a lively curiosity among the audience so the audience sang nous [allons] {allots, allows, alloys,

exclusively of colonels young widows old soldiers and faithful servants never had such widows been seen never such colonels never had old soldiers spoken thus never had such devoted servants been met

contributed not a little towards the fortune made by the manager and to the author's reputation the form of verse itself was changed the old airs of our fathers who had been satisfied with the gay

{} were abandoned for the more artificially mannered comic opera pointed epigrams and long drawn out elegantly turned verses when the situation became touching eight or ten lines would express the feelings of the character borrowing charm from the music and sighing declarations of love for which prose had ceased to suffice in short a charming little bastard sprang into being of which to use a village expression m scribe was both father and godfather and which was neither the old vaudeville nor comic opera nor comedy the models of the new style were the [somnambule] {} [michel] {} [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [christine] {} the [héritière] {} the [mariage] {marriage, marriage} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [raison] {raisin} [philippe] {} and [marraine] {} later some [vaudevilles] {vaudeville}

{be, he, me, re, we} [bohème] {} these bordered on comedy and could at a pinch be played without lines other changes will be pointed out so far as they affected the arts let us briefly state here that we had entered into the age of transition in 1818 scribe began by the vaudeville from 1818 to 1820 [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} and [lamartine] {} appeared in the literary world the former with his odes [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [ballades] {ballads} the latter with his [méditations] {meditations} the first attempts of the new poetry from 1820 to 1824 [nodier] {nosier} published novels of a kind which introduced a fresh type namely the picturesque from 1824 to 1828 it was the turn of painting to attempt fresh styles finally from 1828 to 1835 the revolution spread to the dramatic world and followed almost immediately on the footsteps of the historical and imaginative novel thus the nineteenth century freed from parental restraint assumed its true [colour] {color} and originality of course it will be understood that as i was so closely associated with all the great artists and all the great sculptors of the time each of them will come into these memoirs in turn they will constitute a gigantic gallery wherein every illustrious name shall have its living monument let us return to [soulié] {} we had reached the date when his first piece of poetry had the [honour] {honor} of print it

[soulié] {} read it to us here it is we give it in order to indicate the point of departure of all our great poets when we take note of the end to which they have attained we can measure the distance traversed probably some contemporary grumblers will tell us it matters very little where they started or where they ended to such we would reply that we are not merely writing for the year 1851 or the

[le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} has just asked me for someone to copy quickly and neatly a piece of work he has prepared for his counsel although there is nothing secret about it you must understand that it will not do to have the papers left about in the office while being copied i thought of you because you write rapidly and correctly it will be the means of bringing you before the duke i am going to take you into his room i must confess i felt greatly excited on learning that i was about to find myself face to face with a man whose influence might be of much importance in the shaping of my destiny [oudard] {} noticed the effect this news produced on me and tried to reassure me by telling me of the perfect kindness of the duke this did not at all prevent me from feeling very nervous as i approached his royal highness's room i had a moment's respite for his royal highness was at breakfast but i soon heard a step that i guessed was his and fear seized me once more the door opened and the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} appeared i had seen him already once or twice at [villers] {fillers, killers, millers, tillers} [cotterets] {} when he came to the sale of the woods i believe i said that he stayed then with m [collard] {collars, collar, collared} from whom he was the recipient of the most lavish hospitality imaginable although so far as he himself was concerned the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} always tried to restrain hospitality offered him within the limits of a simple family visit m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} had as a matter of fact the good feeling to [recognise] {recognize} almost publicly his illegitimate relations he had his two natural uncles the two [abbés] {abbes} saint [phar] {char, pear, par} and saint [albin] {albino} living with him at the [palais] {} royal and he did not make any distinction between them and the other members of his family the prince would be fifty years old the following [october] {} he was still a very good looking man though his figure was marred by his stoutness which had increased during the past ten years his face was frank his eyes bright and intelligent without depth or steadfastness he was fluently affable but nevertheless his words never lost their aristocratic [savour] {savor} unless his sole interest were to conciliate a vain citizen he had a pleasant voice which in his good [humoured] {humored} moments was usually kind in tone and when he was in the mood he could be heard even a long way off singing the mass in a voice almost as out of tune as that of [louis] {louts} [xv] {v, x} i have since heard him sing the [marseillaise] {} as falsely as he sang the mass to make a long story short i was presented to him not much ceremony was observed in my case [monseigneur] {} this is m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} of whom i have spoken to you the [protégé] {} of general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} oh good replied the duke i was delighted to do something to please general [foy] {boy, coy, joy, soy, toy} who recommended you very warmly to me monsieur you are the son of a brave man whom [bonaparte] {} is said to have left almost to die of starvation i bowed in token of affirmation you write a very good hand you make and seal envelopes excellently work and m [oudard] {} will look after you in the meantime [oudard] {} interposed [monseigneur] {} wishes to entrust you with an important piece of work his highness desires it to be done promptly and correctly i will not leave it until it is finished i replied and i will do my utmost to be as accurate as his highness requires the duke made a sign to [oudard] {} as much as to say not bad for a country lad then going before me he said come into this room and sit down at that table and with these words he pointed out a desk to me here you will be undisturbed he then opened a bundle in which about fifty pages were arranged in order covered on both sides with his big handwriting and numbered at the front of each page see he said copy from here to there if you finish before i come back you must wait for me i have several corrections to make in certain passages and i will make them as i dictate them to you i sat down and set to work at my task the work with which i was entrusted was concerned with an event which had recently made a great stir and which could not fail to take up the attention of [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} this was the claim made by maria [stella] {stellar} [petronilla] {} [chiappini] {} baroness of [sternberg] {} to the rank and fortune of the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} which she contended belonged to her here is the fable upon which her pretension was founded we give it from maria [stella's] {} point of view without be it well understood believing for a single instant in the justice of her claim madame la [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [d'orléans] {} who was married in 1768 had to the beginning of [january] {} 1772 only presented her husband [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} [joseph] {} [d'orléans] {} with a still born daughter the absence of male issue troubled the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} greatly as his fortune derived chiefly from portions granted him as a younger son would in default of male issue revert to the crown it was with this in his mind and in the hope that travel might perhaps lead to the [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [d'orléans] {} being again pregnant that [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} and his wife set out for [italy] {} in the early part of the year 1772 under the name of the [comte] {cote, come} and [comtesse] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} i repeat for the last time that throughout this narrative it is not i who am speaking but the claimant maria [stella] {stellar} [petronilla] {} well the august [travellers] {travelers, travelers} had scarcely reached the top of the [apennines] {} before symptoms of a fresh pregnancy declared themselves which caused the [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [d'orléans] {} to stay at [modigliana] {} in the village of [modigliana] {} there was a prison and a [gaoler] {} to watch over the prison the [gaoler] {} was called [chiappini] {} m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} faithful to his traditions of familiarity with the people became on still more easy terms with the [gaoler] {} as the intimacy took place under cover of his incognito there was besides a reason for the intimacy [chiappini's] {} wife was expecting her confinement just at the same time as madame la [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [d'orléans] {} a treaty was accordingly entered into between the illustrious [travellers] {travelers, travelers} and the humble [gaoler] {} to the effect that should madame la [comtesse] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} by chance give birth to a girl and the wife of [chiappini] {} to a boy the two mothers should exchange their two children fate ordained matters as the parents had foreseen the [gaoler's] {} wife gave birth to a boy the prince's wife gave birth to a girl and the agreed exchange was made the prince handing over a considerable sum to the [gaoler] {} as well the child destined to play the part of prince was then transported to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and although he was born as far back as 17 [april] {} 1773 the fact was kept secret till 6 [october] {} on which date it was declared and the child was baptized by the [almoner] {} of the [palais] {} royal in the presence of the parish priest and of two valets in the meantime the duchess's daughter left in [italy] {} was brought up there under the name of maria [stella] {stellar} [petronilla] {} the rest of the story can be guessed nevertheless we will give it in detail maria [stella] {stellar} did not know the story of her birth until after the death of the [gaoler] {} [chiappini] {} she had a melancholy childhood the [gaoler's] {} wife who regretted her son and who was for ever reproaching her husband for the agreement made rendered the child's life very miserable the young girl was it seems extremely beautiful and at the age of seventeen she made such a deep impression upon lord [newborough] {} one of the wealthiest noblemen of [england] {} who was passing through [modigliana] {} that he married her almost in spite of herself and took her away to [london] {} she was left a widow very young with several children one of whom is now a peer of [england] {} but she soon married the baron [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [sternberg] {} who took her away to [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [petersburg] {} where she presented him with a son one day the baroness [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [sternberg] {} who was almost separated from her husband received a letter with an [italian] {} postmark she opened it and read the following lines written by the hand of the man whom she believed to be her father [milady] {malady} i have at last reached the close of my life without having revealed to anyone a secret which closely concerns you and me this secret is as follows the day on which you were born of a lady whose name i cannot divulge and who has already departed this life i also had a child born to me a boy i was asked to make an exchange and taking into consideration the impoverished state of my fortune at that time i consented to the urgent and advantageous proposals made to me it was then i adopted you as my daughter and at the same time the other person adopted my son i perceive that heaven has made up for my wrongdoing since you are placed in a higher station in life than your father though he was in almost the same rank and it is this reflection which allows me to die with some degree of [tranquillity] {tranquility, tranquility} keep this before your mind so that you may not hold me wholly responsible although i ask your forgiveness for my error i earnestly beseech you to keep the fact secret in order that the world may not be able to talk about a matter now past remedy this letter will not even be sent you until after my death [laurent] {} [chiappini] {} upon receipt of this letter maria [stella] {stellar} at once prepared to travel to [italy] {} she did not agree with the [gaoler] {} [chiappini] {} in thinking the matter irremediable she wished to know who was her true father she gathered information wherever she could find it and at length she learned that in 1772 in other words a year before her birth two french [travellers] {travelers, travelers} arrived at [modigliana] {} and remained there until the month of [april] {} 1773 these two [travellers] {travelers, travelers} called themselves the [comte] {cote, come} and [comtesse] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} upon this slight clue the baroness [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [sternberg] {} set off to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} and began by visiting the little town of [joinville] {} whose name her father bore here she [learnt] {learns, learn} that [joinville] {} had once been an inheritance belonging to the [orléans] {} family and that [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [louis] {louts} [philippe] {} [joseph] {} who had been [travelling] {traveling, traveling} in [italy] {} in 1772 had died upon the scaffold in 1793 only his son the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} was left (the two younger brothers having died the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [montpensier] {} in [england] {} and the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [beaujolais] {} at [malta)] {} the inheritor of the whole of his father's wealth he lived in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and he was the only prince of the blood of the house of [orléans] {} maria [stella] {stellar} left immediately for [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} made useless efforts to gain access to the duke himself gave herself into the hands of intriguing persons who exploited her cause to business men who cheated her and ended by writing to the papers stating that the baroness [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [sternberg] {} who was the bearer of a communication of the greatest importance to the heirs of the [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} had arrived in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and desired to acquaint them with this communication at the earliest possible opportunity the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} did not wish to receive this communication direct neither did he desire to have recourse to the agency of a business man he commissioned his uncle the old [abbé] {abbe, abbr} of saint [phar] {char, pear, par} to call on the baroness [1] then everything was laid bare and the duke discovered the whole plot that was being weaved about him learning that whether from honest belief or from cupidity maria [stella] {stellar} seriously meant to pursue her cause and that she was going to return to [italy] {} to furnish herself with documents [wherewith] {therewith, herewith} to establish her identity he hastened to take the precaution of preparing a memoir intended for his counsel to refute the fabrication by the aid of which maria [stella] {stellar} intended to take away his rank and his fortune or at all events to make him pay for the right to keep them in the meantime she was appealing to the [duchesse] {duchess, duchesses} [d'angoulême] {} as the likeliest person to [harbour] {harbor} the liveliest feelings of resentment against the [orléans] {} family it was this memoir that i was called upon to copy i must own that i did not transcribe it without reading it although my total ignorance of history left many points obscure to me in the prince's refutation not only was this paper based upon fact but it was written with that customary power of reasoning which the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} was noted for exercising even in minor matters of diplomacy he employed counsel for form's sake only for he himself drew up not merely notes on the case he wished to prove but lengthy statements which roused the admiration of the celebrated barrister me [dupin] {duping} to whom they were always sent i came to the end of the portion the duke had told me to write after a couple of [hours'] {hours} work so i put down my work and waited when the duke returned he came to the table at which i was writing picked up my copy made a gesture indicative of his approval of my handwriting but almost immediately afterwards said oh oh you have a punctuation of your own i see and taking a pen he sat down at a corner of the table and began to punctuate my copy according to the rules of grammar the duke flattered me highly by saying i had a punctuation of my own i knew no more about punctuation than about anything else i punctuated according to my fancy or rather i did not punctuate at all to this day i only punctuate on my proofs i believe you could take up any of my manuscripts [hap] {cap, gap, lap, map, nap} hazard and run through a whole volume without finding a single exclamation mark or an acute accent or a grave accent after the duke had read the statement and corrected my punctuation he got up and walking up and down dictated to me the part he wanted to correct i wrote almost as quickly as he dictated which seemed to please him extremely i reached this sentence and if there were nothing else but the striking resemblance which exists between the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} and his illustrious grandfather [louis] {louts} [xiv] {} would not that likeness alone be sufficient to demonstrate the falseness of this adventuress's pretensions although as i have previously stated i was not very well read in history yet in this matter i knew quite enough (as they say in [duelling] {quelling, dwelling, dulling, dueling, dueling} of a man who has had three [months'] {months} training in a fencing [school)] {schools, school} to make a fool of myself that is to say i knew that m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [duc]

illustrious grandfather [louis] {louts} [xiv] {} i looked up it was most impertinent of me a prince is never mistaken and in this instance the prince did not allow himself to be taken in so the [duc] {doc, dub, dud, due, dug} [d'orléans] {} stopped in front of me and said to me [dumas] {pumas, dumps} you should know this when a person is descended from [louis] {louts} [xiv] {} even if only through

not appeared before us although twice summoned so to do by an [archiepiscopal] {} usher of [florence] {} acting on our behalf according to the custom of this [curé] {curb, curd, cure, curl, curs} and whereas the effect of this [contumacy] {} has been duly considered in its bearing on the case in virtue of the [acta] {acts, act} etc having heard the respective defendants etc considering that [laurent] {} [chiappini] {} being near the term of his mortal life did by a letter which was handed to the petitioner after the decease of the said [chiappini] {} reveal to the said petitioner the secret of her birth showing clearly to her that she was not his daughter but the daughter of a person whose name he stated he was bound to withhold that it has been clearly proved by experts that this letter is in the handwriting of [laurent] {} [chiappini] {} that the word of a dying man is proof positive since it is not in his interest any longer to lie and since he is presumably thinking only of his eternal salvation that such a confession must be regarded in the light of a solemn oath and as a deposition made for the benefit of his soul and for [righteousness'] {righteousness, righteousness's} sake that the trustee would essay in vain to impair the validity of the evidence of the said letter on the plea that no mention is made therein as to who were the real father and mother of the petitioner seeing that though such mention is in effect wanting recourse has nevertheless been had on behalf of the same petitioner to testimonial proof to presumption and to conjecture that when there is written proof as in the present case testimonial proof or any other argument may be adduced even when it is a question of personal identity that if in a case of identity following on the principle of written proof proof by witness is also admissible so much the more should it hold good in this case where the demand is confined to a document to be used hereafter in the question of identity considering that it clearly results from the sworn and legal depositions of the witnesses [marie] {maria, mare, marine} and [dominique] {} [marie] {maria, mare, marine} the sisters [bandini] {banding} that there was an agreement between m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} and [signior] {} [chiappini] {} to exchange their respective children in case the countess gave birth to a daughter and [chiappini's] {} wife to a son that such an exchange in effect took place and the event foreseen having come to pass that the daughter was baptized in the church of the priory of [modigliana] {} in the name of maria [stella] {stellar} her parents being falsely declared to be the couple [chiappini] {} that they are in entire agreement as to the date of the exchange which coincides with that of the birth of the petitioner and that they allege reasons in support of their [cognisance] {cognizance} etc considering that it is in vain for the trustee to attack the likelihood of this evidence since not only is there nothing impossible in their statements but they are on the contrary supported and corroborated by a very large number of other presumptions and conjectures that one very strong conjecture is based on public [rumour] {rumor} and on gossip that was rife at the time in connection with the exchange such public [rumour] {rumor} when allied to past events having the value of truth and of full [cognisance] {cognizance} that this public [rumour] {rumor} is proved not only by the depositions of the aforesaid sisters [bandini] {banding} but also by the attestation of monsieur [dominique] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [valle] {value, valve, vale, vale, valley} and by those of the other witnesses of [bringhella] {} and of witnesses from [ravenna] {} all of which were legally and judicially examined in their places of origin and before their respective tribunals that the vicissitudes experienced by m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} are convincing testimony to the reality of the exchange that there is documentary evidence to prove that in consequence of the [rumour] {rumor} current at [modigliana] {} on the subject of the said exchange the [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} was compelled to take flight and to seek refuge in the convent of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [bernard] {} of [brisighella] {} and that while out walking he was arrested and then after having been detained some time in the public hall at [brisighella] {} he was taken by the [swiss] {swigs, swims, swish} guards of [ravenna] {} before his eminence m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} cardinal legate who set him at liberty etc that m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} [biancoli] {} [borghi] {} attests in his judicial examination that while sorting some old papers of the [borghi] {} family he came upon a letter written from [turin] {turn} to m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} [pompée] {} [borghi] {} the date of which he does not recollect signed 'louis [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} ' which stated that the changeling had died and that any scruple on its account was now removed considering that the said [comte] {cote, come} [biancoli] {} [borghi] {} alleges [cognisance] {cognizance} in his depositions that the fact of the exchange is further proved by the subsequently improved fortunes of [chiappini] {} etc that the latter spoke of the exchange to a certain don [bandini] {banding} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [variozo] {} etc that the petitioner received an education suitable to her distinguished rank and not such as would have been given to the daughter of a [gaoler] {} etc that it results clearly from all the counts so far pleaded and from several others contained in the [pleadings] {pleasings, pleading} that maria [stella] {stellar} was falsely declared in the act of birth to be the daughter of [chiappini] {} and his wife and that she owes her birth to m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} and madame la [comtesse] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [joinville] {} that it is in consequence a matter of simple justice to permit the correction of the certificate of birth as now demanded by the said maria [stella] {stellar} lastly that [dr] {fr, gr, hr, or, yr} [thomas] {} [chiappini] {} instead of opposing her demand has committed [contumacy] {} having repeated the very holy name of god we declare hold and definitely pronounce judgment as follows that the objections raised by the trustee the aforesaid

man of letters since he had ordered a quatrain from [lemierre] {} and a comedy from [merville] {} we have already related that m [arnault] {} whose [marius] {} à [minturnes] {} had succeeded in spite of monsieur's prediction paid in all probability for this want of respect for the opinion of his royal highness by four years of exile on the return of the [bourbons] {bourbon} and this was not

though he were a lackey an act which caused that worthy gentleman to remark on receiving his dismissal it is strange for i have not stolen the king's watch without counting [magallon] {} whom he sent to [poissy] {prissy} chained to a scurvy convict without counting m [arnault] {} whom he banished from the country there was besides a little story of the same kind in connection with [beaumarchais] {} more than once has m [arnault] {} related in my hearing the curious and too little known history of [beaumarchais'] {} imprisonment these are the facts there is always a public censorship except during the first two or three months following the accession of princes to the throne and the two or three months after they are deposed but when these three months have elapsed the censorship reappears on the waters after its plunge and proceeds to discover some minister preferably of liberal or even republican tendencies and to lay a snare for him when the [mariage] {marriage, marriage} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [figaro] {} was running its course m [suard] {guard, shard, sward} was censor and he was also a journalist he was one of those who had most bitterly opposed the representation of [beaumarchais'] {} work and he was largely responsible for the fifty nine journeys [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [marais] {} à la police that the illustrious author made without being able to obtain leave for his play to be performed at length thanks to the intervention of the queen and the [comte] {cote, come} [d'artois] {} the [folle] {folly} [journée] {} recovered intact out of the claws of these gentlemen was played on 27 [april] {} 1784 m [suard] {guard, shard, sward} was vindictive both in his capacity as censor and as a journalist so that if he could not exercise the censorship by the use of scissors he had recourse to his pen m [suard] {guard, shard, sward} was on very familiar terms with the [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [provence] {province} and he served the [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [provence] {province} as a screen when his royal highness wished to give vent incognito to some petty literary spite m [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [provence] {province} detested [beaumarchais] {} almost as much as did m [suard] {guard, shard, sward} himself the result was that the [comte] {cote, come} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [provence] {province} hastened to unburden himself by means of m [suard] {guard, shard, sward} in the journal [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} against the unfortunate [mariage] {marriage, marriage} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [figaro] {} which continued its successful run in spite of m [suard's] {guard's, shard's, sward's} signed articles or the anonymous articles of his royal highness in the meantime [beaumarchais] {} handed over the sum of about thirty or forty thousand francs which he received as author's rights in the [mariage] {marriage, marriage} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [figaro] {} to the association for helping poor foster mothers monsieur who had not got a child (a less polite chronicler than myself would say who was incapable of begetting [one)] {ones, one} and who consequently owing to his failing in this respect had not much sympathy with foster mothers indulged himself always under the cloak of anonymity in attacking the man after having attacked the play and wrote a letter against him in the journal [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} overflowing with venomous spleen [beaumarchais] {} who thought he [recognised] {recognized} this onslaught as from the hand of m [suard] {guard, shard, sward} proceeded to lash the pedant soundly as ill luck would have it it was his royal highness who received the tanning intended for the censor's hide monsieur smarting under the stripes went with the story of his grievances to [louis] {louts} [xvi] {} giving him to understand that [beaumarchais] {} was perfectly well aware that he was not replying to the royal censor but to the brother of the king [louis] {louts} [xvi] {} offended on behalf of monsieur commanded the citizen who dared to take the liberty of chastising a royal personage regardless of his rank to be arrested and taken to a house of correction not to the [bastille] {} that prison being considered too good for such a worthless scamp and as his majesty was playing [loo] {boo, coo, goo, moo, too} when he made this decision it was on the back of a seven of spades that the order was written for [beaumarchais'] {} arrest and his committal to saint [lazare] {} thus we see that when [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} had [magallon] {} taken to [poissy] {prissy} he remained faithful to monsieur's traditions apropos of the censorship a good story of the present censor is going the rounds this 6th of [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} 1851 we will inquire into it and if it be true we will relate it in the next chapter this excellent institution furnishes so many other instances of a like nature that its facts and achievements have to be registered regardless of

managed since m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} was an old royalist and i believe a soldier of [condi's] {condo's} army it was not a case of making a convert but retaining an old partisan his articles in the gazette signed [l'ermite] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [chaussée] {} [d'antin] {} had an enormous success i heard it said at the time that m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} was called up before m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [vitrolles] {} and asked to mention what it was he wanted what he wanted was the due recognition of his services namely the cross of saint [louis] {louts} for as a rule straightforward men only desire things they are entitled to desiring the cross and having deserved it he asked for it but they wished to force conditions upon him they desired that he should not merely be satisfied with refraining from pointing fun at the absurdities of the restoration they wanted him to [emphasise] {emphasize, emphasis} the glories of the empire they wanted him to do a base action before he a loyal soldier a clean handed man a poet of considerable repute among his [confrères] {confreres} could obtain the cross what happened the noted poet the loyal soldier the honest man said that the cross should go to [hades] {fades, jades, lades, sades, wades} first and he showed the person who came to propose these conditions to the door it was the right way to treat the minister but it was unlucky for the cross which would not have [honoured] {honored} m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} but which m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy}

generation reads me it will read him for i am about to open his works and to quote some pages from them at [hap] {cap, gap, lap, map, nap} hazard they go back to the first months of the second return

words i formerly had the [honour] {honor} to be attached to one of the princes of the house of bourbon i may even have been so fortunate as to show some proofs of my devotion to that august family at a time when if not meritorious it was at least dangerous to allow one's zeal to leak out but i [endeavour] {endeavor} not to forget that the [mornays] {morays} the [sullys] {sully} the [crillons] {carillons} would modestly style this the [fulfilment] {fulfillment, fulfillment} of one's duty i am unaware upon what grounds people in my province credit me with what i do not enjoy and to which i am indebted for the hosts of solicitations i receive without being able to be of service to those who apply to me i have only discovered one method of escaping from this novel form of persecution that is to publish a letter of one of my relatives and the answer i thought fit to make to it the first is in some measure a [résumé] {} of three or four hundred letters that i have received on the same topic i am the less reluctant to make it public since i reserve to myself the right of holding back the writer's name and besides this letter reflects as much credit on the heart of the writer as it displays the good sense of the mind that dictated it b [de] {be, he, me, re, we} l this is the relative's letter how glad i am my friend that events have brought back our illustrious princes to the throne what good fortune it is you have no notion what reputation these events and your stay in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} give me here the prefect is afraid of me and his wife who never used to bow to me has invited me twice to dinner but there is no time to be lost and we rely on you would you believe that my husband has not yet taken any steps whatever to regain his position pretending that it exists no longer and that the commission was made up to him in [assignats] {} there isn't a more apathetic man in the whole of [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} my brother in law has laid claim to the cross of saint [louis] {louts} he had been waiting for it for nine years when the revolution broke out it would be unjust of them not to compensate him for the twenty years of his services the troubles and the misfortunes he has undergone on his estates he is counting on you to hasten the prompt [despatch] {dispatch} of his patent i append a memorandum to my letter from my oldest son the marquis he had the right to his uncle's reversion and it will be easy for you to obtain it for him i am anxious that his brother the [chevalier] {} shall be placed in the navy but in a rank worthy of his name and the past services of his family and as my grandson [auguste] {august, auguster} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} g is quite old enough i to become a page you have only to speak a word on his behalf we are coming to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} early next month i shall bring my daughter with me as i wish to present her at court they will not refuse you this [favour] {favor} if you solicit it with sufficient perseverance and willingness think of poor f he failed us it is true at the time of the revolution but he has made ample amends during the past month you know he is penniless and is ready to sacrifice everything for our rulers his devotion goes even so far as to be willing to take a post as prefect and he is well fitted for it do you not remember the pretty song he made about me m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} b son of the late [intendant] {} of the province is coming to see you try and be useful to him he is a friend of the family if they are not going to re establish [intendancies] {} he will be satisfied with a post as receiver general it is the least they can do for a man devoted to his sovereign one who was imprisoned for six months during the terror i must not forget to recommend m to your notice he has been blamed for having served all parties because he has been employed in every government in [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} for the last twenty years but he is a good fellow you can take my word for it he was the first to don the white cockade besides all he asks is to be allowed to keep his place as superintendent of the posting service be sure and write to me under cover of his frank i append my father in law's papers a sum of forty five thousand francs is still owing to him from the estates of [languedoc] {} i hope they will not keep you waiting for its reimbursement and that you will not hesitate to make use of the money if you are under any temporary embarrassment though this is very unlikely in your present situation adieu my dear cousin with greetings in which the whole family unite and expecting the pleasure of seeing you soon in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} j [de] {be, he, me, re, we} p [answer] [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} 15 [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} 1814 my dear cousin you can hardly conceive with what interest i have read the letter you have done me the [honour] {honor} to send me or with what zeal i have tried to further the just and reasonable demands of all the persons you recommend to my notice you will not be more astonished than i have been myself at the obstacles placed in my way which you would deem insurmountable if you knew as well as i the people with whom we have to deal when i spoke of your son who has long been desirous of service and asked for a berth as major in his father's old regiment they urged as a not unreasonable objection that peace was concluded and that before thinking of a position for the marquis [de] {be, he, me, re, we} v they must consider the lot of 25 000 officers some of whom (would you believe it ) press for the recognition of their campaigns their wounds and even go so far as to urge the number of battles in which they were engaged whilst others more directly associated with the misfortunes of the royal family had returned to [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} without any fortune beyond the goodwill and complaisance of the king i then asked with a touch of sarcasm what they meant to do for your son and for the multitude of brave royalists who have suffered so much through the misfortunes of the realm and whose secret prayers for the recall of the royal family to the throne of its ancestors had been unceasing they replied that they rejoiced to see the end of all our afflictions and the [fulfilment] {fulfillment, fulfillment} of our prayers your husband is a very extraordinary man i can well understand my dear cousin all you must be suffering on account of his incredible apathy to be reduced at the age of sixty five or sixty six at the outside to a fortune of 40 000 [livres] {lives} income to bury himself in the depth of a [château] {chateau} and to renounce all chance of an ambitious career as though a father had no duty towards his children as though a gentleman ought not to die fighting i am sorry your brother in law should have laid claim to the cross of saint [louis] {louts} before it had been granted to him for it may happen that the king will not readily part with the right to confer this decoration himself and that he will not approve of the [honour] {honor} certain persons are anxious to have conferred upon them you will [realise] {realize, realism, realist} that it would be less awkward not to have had the cross of saint [louis] {louts} than to find oneself obliged to give it up i did not forget to put forward the claims of your son the [chevalier] {} and i do not despair of getting him entered for the examination of officers for the royal marines we will then do our utmost to get him passed into the staff of one hundred officers who are far too conscious of their worth of the names they bear and of the devotion they profess to have shown at [quiberon] {} your grandson [auguste] {august, auguster} is entered for a page i cannot tell you exactly when he will be taken into the palace my dear cousin as your request followed upon three thousand seven hundred and seventy five other requests made on behalf of the sons of noblemen or officers slain on the field of battle though they cannot show the slightest claim on account of services rendered to the state or to the princes you are well advised in wishing to place your daughter at court and it will not be difficult when you have found a husband for her whose rank and fortune will entitle her to a position there if this is not arranged i do not quite see what she would do there or what suitable post she could occupy there however able she may be maids of [honour] {honor} are not yet reinstated i have presented a petition in [favour] {favor} of f to which i annexed the pretty song he composed for you but they have become so exacting that such claims no longer suffice to obtain a post as prefect i will even go so far as to tell you that they do not think much of your [protégé's] {} conversion and of the sacrifices he is prepared to make his enemies persist in saying that he is not a man who can be relied upon i witnessed his powers of work in former times and i am convinced that if he would serve the good cause nowadays with half the zeal he formerly exerted on behalf of the bad cause they would be able very usefully to employ him but will this ever be put to the test i have not [learnt] {learns, learn} whether [intendances] {} are to be re established but they seem to think that public [receiverships] {receivership} will be diminished if only in the number of those which exist in departments beyond our bounds this makes me fear that m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} b will have to be satisfied with the enormous fortune his father made in the old revenue days which he found means to hide during the revolutionary storms he must learn to be philosophical do not be in the least uneasy over the lot of m i know him he has considerable elasticity of character and of principle for twenty years he has slipped in and out among all parties without having offended any he is a [marvellously] {marvelously, marvelously} clever fellow who will serve himself better than anyone else ever will be served he is no longer superintendent of the posting bureau having just obtained a more lucrative post in another department of the government do you always take such great interest in his affairs i return you your father in law's papers dear cousin relative to the debt on the [languedoc] {} estates from what i can gather the liquidation does not seem likely to take place yet a while in spite of the justice of your claim they have decided that arrears of pay due to troops the public debt military pensions and a crowd of other objects of this nature shall be taken into consideration this measure is evidently the fruit of some intrigue you should tell f to draw up a pamphlet upon the most urgent needs of the state and to [endeavour] {endeavor} to refer to this debt in the first line of his pamphlet you have no idea how much the government is influenced by the multitude of little pamphlets which are produced every day by ill feeling anger and hunger with such commendable zeal you will see my dear cousin that at the rate things are going you must possess your soul in patience i would even add that the journey you propose to take to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} will not advance your affairs according to the police reckoning there are at this present moment a hundred and twenty three thousand people from the provinces of all ranks of all sexes of all ages who are here to make claims furnished with almost as good credentials as yours and who will have the advantage over you in obtaining a refusal of being first in the field to put forward their cases finally as i know you are acquainted with philosophy and the best things in literature i beg you to read over again a chapter in the [english] {} spectator on the just claims of these who ask for posts it is in the thirty second section of the seventh volume in the [duodecimo] {} edition history repeats itself accept my dear cousin an expression of my most affectionate greetings coupled with my sincere regrets b [de] {be, he, me, re, we} l in 1830 after the revolution of [july] {duly, jury} [auguste] {august, auguster} [barbier] {barrier, babier, barber} produced a poem on the same subject entitled the [curée] {curie, curse, curve, cure} when one re reads those terrible verses and compares them with work by m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy] {joy} the writings of the latter seem a model of that attic wit which was characteristic of the old school and [barbier] {barrier, babier, barber} an example of the brutal fiery unpremeditated writing i so typical of his muse meanwhile at about the period we have reached whilst [louis] {louts} [xviii] {} was hunting down men of letters with that ruthlessness of which we have just cited a few examples he was laying claim to a place in their midst through the foolish advice of his sycophants the regal author published a little work entitled voyage [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} à [bruxelles] {} i do not know whether it would be possible to day to procure a single copy of the royal brochure wherein were to be found not only such errors in french grammar as [j'étais] {} [déjà] {} [un] {an, in, on, uh,

relates this act of devotion as though it were no more than the [fugitives'] {fugitives} due and ends the chapter by saying the dinner was execrable it was written in kitchen french as colonel [morisel] {morsel} observed to m [arnault] {} that is easily explained replied the author of [germanicus] {} since the work was by a restaurateur the [miroir] {} ordered to review the voyage [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} à [bruxelles] {} contented itself by saying if the work is by the august personage to whom it is attributed it is above the region of criticism if it is not by him it is beneath criticism let us revert to colonel [morisel] {morsel} one of the most interesting characters of the time they could not get up the same kind of trial against the author of the [messéniennes] {} of the [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} of the [comédiens] {} and of [paria] {maria, parka, aria, pariah} as they did against m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [jouy]

anyone and nobody considered it a crime for he used the influence he acquired by his post at the [palais] {} royal in rendering help to his friends and sometimes even to his enemies just at this

the high public functionaries who had the [honour] {honor} of appearing before our readers in the last chapter did not only strike at literary men but it hit out cruelly bitterly and mortally at public men it began by the expulsion of [manuel] {mantel, manual} from the chamber it closed with the execution of [riégo] {} but i must confess i was not so much occupied at that time with the quarrels of the chamber or the [spanish] {} war or the [fête] {fate, fete} that madame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [cayla] {} (who was very kind to me [later)] {later} gave to saint [ouen] {omen, open,

mademoiselle [georges] {gorges} acted i have told my readers that as celebrated characters appear in these memoirs i will describe them all as clearly as i can in the light of contemporary knowledge some of them only shone for a very short time and their light is now extinguished for ever but what i have to say about them will be all the more interesting on that account for what follows describes my first impressions of them when they were in the zenith of their popularity we have remarked that the age of any living actress is not to be known but reckoning from the year when mademoiselle [georges] {gorges} made her [début] {debut} that is to say from 29 [november] {} 1802 she must have been thirty eight in 1823 just a word to explain how mademoiselle [georges] {gorges} gained access to the [theatre] {} and how she managed to remain on the boards loved by [bonaparte] {} and retained in his [favour] {favor} when he became [napoleon] {} mademoiselle [georges] {gorges} who begged to be allowed to accompany [napoleon] {} to saint [helena] {} is almost a historical personage towards the close of the year 1800 and the beginning of 1801 mademoiselle [raucourt] {} who was leading lady in tragedy at the [théâtre] {} [français] {} went on tour in the provinces this was at a time when although government had plenty to do it was not ashamed to concern itself with the arts in its spare moments mademoiselle [raucourt] {} had therefore received orders from the government to look out for any pupil during her tour whom she might think worth instruction and to bring her back to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} this young lady was to be considered the pupil of the government and would receive a grant of 1200 francs mademoiselle [raucourt] {} stopped at [amiens] {aliens,

mild, mile, milf} had descended from her pedestal mademoiselle [raucourt] {} who was almost as classic in her tastes as the lesbian [sappho] {} admired statuesque beauty immensely when she saw the way this young girl walked her gait that of the goddess to use [virgil's] {virgin's, vigil's} phrase the actress made inquiries and found that her name was [georges] {gorges} [weymer] {} that she was the daughter of a [german] {merman, germane} musician named [georges] {gorges} [weymer] {} manager of the [theatre] {} and of mademoiselle [verteuil] {} the actress who played the chambermaid parts this young lady was destined for tragedy mademoiselle [raucourt] {} made her play Élise with her in [didon] {} and [aricie] {} in [phèdre] {} the experiment succeeded and the very night of the performance of [phèdre] {} mademoiselle [raucourt] {} asked the young [tragédienne's] {} [parents'] {parents} leave to take her the prospect of being a government pupil and better still the pupil of mademoiselle [raucourt] {} was with the exception of some slight drawbacks in the way of regulations to which the young girl had perforce to agree too tempting an offer in the eyes of her parents to be refused the request was granted and mademoiselle [georges] {gorges} departed followed by her mother the lessons lasted eighteen months during these eighteen months the young pupil lived in a poor hotel in the rue [croix] {} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [petits] {petite, petites} champs which probably ironically was named the [hôtel] {hotel} [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [pérou] {} mademoiselle [raucourt] {} lived at the end of the [allée] {} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [veuves] {} in a magnificent house which had belonged to madame [tallien] {tallied, tallies} and which no doubt also ironically was called the cottage (la [chaumière)] {} we have called mademoiselle [georges'] {} residence a magnificent house we should also have said a small house for it was a perfect specimen of a [bijou] {} villa in the style of [louis] {louts} [xv] {v, x} towards the end of the eighteenth century that strange epoch when people called things by their right names [sapho] {} [raucourt] {} enjoyed a reputation the originality of which she took not the least pains to hide mademoiselle [raucourt's] {} attitude towards men was more than indifference it was hatred the writer of these lines has in his

mademoiselle [raucourt] {} whenever the costume of her sex was not indispensable to her adopted that of our sex thus very often in the morning mademoiselle [raucourt] {} gave lessons to her beautiful

period of the drama a part called the french cavalier this part was invariably played by a person decorated with a plumed toque clad in a yellow tunic braided with black ornamented with representations of the sun or of golden palms when the cavalier was a prince and wearing buff leather boots it was not imperative that the hero should be french or wear golden spurs to be a french cavalier the [rôle] {rile, role, rule} was designed on well defined lines and belonged to a particular school [zamore] {} was a french cavalier [orosmane] {} was a french cavalier [philoctètes] {} was a french cavalier the only distinctions between them were as follows [zamore] {} played in a cap decorated with peacock feathers and in a cloak of parrot's feathers with a girdle of ostrich plumes

they are positively indecent young man replied [lafond] {} [zamore] {} is not rich [zamore] {} is a slave [zamore] {} could not afford to buy himself a new girdle every day i am true to history what was perhaps less true to history was the expansive stomach which the girdle enclosed [lafond's] {} triumphs in these cavalier parts made [talma] {} nearly die of envy one day [geoffroy's] {} articles exasperated him to such a degree that on meeting the critic in the wings he flew at him and bit him at the risk of poisoning himself but as the law of universal stability decrees that every bullet

members of the school of [larive] {} drew receipts no longer even when they played the parts of [chevaliers] {} [français] {} [lafond] {} was an odd fellow in other ways besides thanks to his [gascon] {} accent and to his way of saying things one never knew whether he were talking nonsense or saying something witty he once came into the lounge of the [théâtre] {} [français] {} when [colson] {colon} (an indifferent actor who was often [hissed)] {hissed} was blurting out his caricature of [lafond's] {} trick of over acting [colson] {colon} pulled himself up but it was too late [lafond] {} had

form any idea they tell me you have been taking me off oh m [lafond] {} [colson] {colon} replied trying to recover himself take you off no i swear i all right all right that was what i was told come [colson] {colon} do me a [favour] {favor} what is it m [lafond] {} act my part before me oh m [lafond] {} i beg you to do it i shall really be extremely obliged to you the deuce said [colson] {colon}

declaimed it from the first line to the last with such fidelity of imitation that one might have thought [lafond] {} himself were declaiming [lafond] {} listened to the end with the deepest attention nodding his head up and down and expressing his approbation by frequent and obvious signs then when [colson] {colon} had finished he said well why ever don't you act like that my dear fellow the

his absence although as we shall see in its proper place the play was rejected the reading excited some interest and it was thought that a drama might be made out of it sooner or later one day i saw the door of my humble office open and m [lafond] {} was announced i raised my head greatly surprised unable to imagine why i should be [favoured] {favored} by a visit from the viceroy of the tragic stage it was indeed he i offered him a chair but he refused it with a nod of the head and stopping close to the door with his right foot forward and his left hand resting on his hips he said monsieur [dumas] {pumas, dumps} do you happen to have by any chance in your play a well set up gallant who would say to that queer queen [christine] {} 'madame your majesty has no right to kill that poor devil of a [monaldeschi] {} for this that or any other [reason'] {reasons, reason, reason's} no monsieur no i have no such gallant in my play you are quite sure you haven't yes in that case i have nothing to say to you good day m [dumas] {pumas, dumps} and turning on his heel he went out as he had entered he had come to ask me for the part of this well set up gallant as he called it unfortunately as i had been compelled to acknowledge i had no such part in my play in the heyday of his popularity m [lafond] {} never spoke of [talma] {} or of m [talma] {} he said the other person the [comte] {cote,

[lafond] {} she was really kind [hearted] {hearten, heated} and her great successes never made her vain she was born in 1777 one year before mademoiselle mars at saint [saulve] {salve} near [valenciennes] {} and she changed her name after her [début] {debut} in [phèdre] {} in 1802 from [joséphine] {} [ruffin] {muffin, puffin, ruffian, ruffing} to [duchesnois] {} we have said that she was mile [georges'] {} rival in everything her rival on the stage her rival in love [harel] {hazel, hared, harem, hares, hare} was the handsome [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} who was the

la [porte] {forte, torte, ports, pore, port} saint martin will play a great part in these memoirs the part that a clever man be it known has the right to play everywhere mademoiselle [duchesnois] {} had had to struggle all her life against her plain looks she was like one of those china lions one sees on balustrades she had a particularly big nose which she blew [stentoriously] {} as befitted its size [lassagne] {} did not dare to go into the orchestra on days when she acted he was afraid of being blown away on the other hand she had a [marvellous] {marvelous, marvelous} figure and her body

which allowed her and [lafond] {} to appear almost naked she possessed a certain simplicity of mind which her detractors called stupidity one day in 1824 people were busy talking about the inundation of [st] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [petersburg] {} and of the various more or less picturesque accidents that had occurred through this inundation i was in the wings behind [talma] {} and mademoiselle

had time to climb up on a crane what on a crane said mademoiselle [duchesnois] {} in great astonishment is it possible [talma] {} oh my dear replied the actor questioned so oddly no one ought to know better than yourself that it is done every day but in spite of her ugliness in spite of her simplicity in spite of her hiccough in spite of her nose blowing mademoiselle [duchesnois] {} possessed the most profoundly tender inflections in her voice and could express such pathetic sorrow that most of those who saw her in [marie] {maria, mare, marine} [stuart] {start} prefer her to day to mademoiselle [rachel] {} especially did her qualities shine when she played with [talma] {} [talma] {} was too great an artiste too superb an actor to fear being [outbidden] {} [talma] {} gave her excellent advice which her fine artistic nature [utilised] {utilized} if not with remarkable intelligence at least with easy assimilation the poor creature retired from the stage in 1830 after having struggled as long as she could against the pitiless indifference of the public and the cruel hints from other actors which generally embitter the later years of dramatic artistes she reappeared once again before her death in 1835 in [athalie] {} at the opera i believe it was very sad to see her it inevitably brought to mind the line from [pierre] {pierce} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [portugal] {} [inès] {inks, inns, ins} [vivante] {} [ou] {cu, mu, nu, of, oh} non [tu] {cu, mu, nu, ti, to} [seras] {serfs, eras, seas} [couronnée] {} alas poor [duchesnois] {} was crowned when she was more than

later that it was desired that his head should be exposed in order that his mute lips and the eyes closed by death might bear witness to the fact that royalty can be cruel for more than a day's span and common people ungrateful on 27 [september] {} he was arrested at [cadiz] {} let us say a few words concerning his arrest and death the latter especially for alas i it belongs almost to french history after his last defeat general [riégo] {} wandered in the mountains with a score of his comrades all of whom belonged like himself to the liberal party fifteen of these fugitives were officers they were all exhausted by fatigue and hunger and did not know either where to look for shelter or from whom to beg food when they caught sight of two men they made straight for them these two men were the hermit of the district of [pédrogil] {} and a native of [valez] {vales, valet, vale} named [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} [lara] {lira, lama, lava, lard, lark} the general took them aside my friends he said to them you have a chance to win a fortune for yourselves and your families what must we do to gain it the two men asked conduct me safe and sound to [carolina] {caroling} to [carboneras] {} and to novas [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [tolosa] {} and there there i shall find friends who will take me on to [estremadura] {} where i have business to transact whether the journey appeared to them too long or whether they fancied they had to deal with outlaws the hermit and his companion declined so [riégo] {} arrested them put them on a couple of mules and told them that whether willingly or under compulsion they would have to act as guides to his band the party waited until nightfall and then set forth during the march in the darkness [riégo] {} talked with his comrades concerning various events that had recently occurred from which the hermit and [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} [lara] {lira, lama, lava, lard, lark} soon guessed that they were in the company of the notorious [riégo] {} from that moment [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} [lara's] {lira's, lama's, lava's, lard's, lark's} whole thoughts were filled with the idea of handing [riégo] {} over to the royalist authorities when daytime came they had to stop they were near the farm of [baquevisones] {} [riégo] {} announced that he meant to ask for shelter there so he ordered [lara] {lira, lama, lava, lard, lark} to knock at the door [lara] {lira, lama, lava, lard, lark} obeyed by chance his own brother [matéo] {matzo} opened it [lara] {lira, lama, lava, lard, lark} perceived that chance had brought him the assistance he needed [riégo] {} [realising] {realizing} that too large an escort might betray him would only allow three of his comrades to go in with him one of these companions was an [englishman] {} even more daring than [riégo] {} he at once locked the door of the farm behind him and put the key in his pocket when they had given the horses fodder they rested in the stable each with his naked sword by his side three slept while the fourth mounted guard when [riégo] {} [awaked] {awaken, awakes, waked, awake} he discovered that his horse was [unshod] {} he ordered [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} [lara] {lira, lama, lava, lard, lark} to shoe the horse immediately all right replied he but i must take him to [arguillos] {} to get him shod no returned [riégo] {} you shall stay here and [matéo] {matzo} shall have him shod but the [farrier] {barrier, carrier, tarrier, furrier} shall come here the horse shall not go to him [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} appeared to conform with indifference to this order but as he transmitted it to his brother he managed to say the man who owns the horse is general [riégo] {} so ho said [matéo] {matzo} arrange for him to be at breakfast by the time i return do not leave the place where they are or let them out of your sight [matéo] {matzo} returned and made a sign to his brother that the commission was executed then to [riégo] {} he said [señor] {} as the [farrier] {barrier, carrier, tarrier, furrier} will be here in five minutes you had better breakfast if you wish to proceed on your journey directly your horse is shod [riégo] {} went to breakfast without making any objection but not so the [englishman] {} the [englishman] {} searched the high road with his field glasses from a window as far as he could see suddenly a score of armed men came into sight headed by an [alcade] {arcade} (magistrate) general he exclaimed we have been betrayed there are soldiers coming to arms cried [riégo] {} rising he had time to utter this cry but not to accomplish its [fulfilment] {fulfillment, fulfillment} [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} and [matéo] {matzo} seized their guns and covered the outlaws with them the first man who moves is dead cried [lopez] {loped, lopes, lope} all right said [riégo] {} i surrender but warn the soldiers who are coming not to harm us since we are your prisoners the soldiers entered led by the [alcade] {arcade} shake hands brother and do us no harm said [riégo] {} to the [alcade] {arcade} after some objection the [alcade] {arcade} greeted [riégo] {} but in spite of this he told him he must bind his hands whereupon [riégo] {} took out of his pocket all the money he had with him and distributed it among the soldiers asking them to treat him mercifully the [alcade] {arcade} however forbade the soldiers to accept anything a quarter of an hour later the civil commandant arrived from [arguillos] {} with a guard and they took the prisoners to [andujar] {} when the captives entered that town the people wanted to tear them limb from limb [riégo] {} was accompanied by a french officer when he arrived in front of the same balcony from which a year ago he had harangued the people he pointed to the crowd which surrounded him howling and shaking their fists and knives at him and in a tone of profound sadness he said to the officer these people whom you see so relentless towards me these people who if i had not been under the protection of your escort would have butchered me long since these people carried me here in triumph only last year the town was illuminated the whole night through and the very same individuals whom i [recognise] {recognize} surrounding me here who then deafened me with cries of 'vive [riégo] {} ' now shout 'death to [riégo] {} ' he was taken to the seminary of nobles his trial lasted over a month a decree dated 1 [october] {} the very day on which he was freed from prison and reached the port of [sainte] {saints, saint} [marie] {maria, mare, marine} degraded the general of all his [honours] {honors} consequently he was tried by a civil court the king of [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} gained a twofold advantage by depriving the general of a military court martial first he knew that the civil court would condemn [riégo] {} to death second if the sentence were pronounced by a civil court the death would be ignominious vengeance is such a sweet mouthful that it must not be permitted to lose any of its [flavour] {flavor} on 4 [november] {} they led [riégo] {} from the seminary of nobles to the prison of la tour the court had not obtained all it demanded the attorney general requisitioned that [riégo] {} should be condemned to the gallows that his estate should be confiscated and given to the commune that his head should be exposed at [las] {gas, has, mas, pas, was} [cabesas] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [san] {ban, can, fan, man, pan} [juan] {} that his body should be quartered and one quarter sent to [seville] {} another to the isle of [leon] {neon, peon, lion, loon, lean} the third to [malaga] {} and the fourth exposed in [madrid] {} in the usual places for such exhibitions these towns being the attorney general added the principal places where the traitor [riégo] {} scattered the sparks of revolt the [alcades] {arcades} decided that the mode of death should be by hanging and that the goods should be confiscated but they refused the request concerning the four quarters once towards the end of the fifteenth century the inhabitants of [imola] {} a small town in the [romagna] {} found on waking up the four quarters of a man hanging each by a hook at the four corners of the square they [recognised] {recognized} the man cut into four quarters for a [florentine] {} and wrote to the worshipful republic to advise them of the unforeseen accident that had overtaken one of its citizens the republic [learnt] {learns, learn} of this by means of [machiavelli] {} its ambassador to the legations [machiavelli's] {} only reply was as follows noble lords i have but one thing to say to you apropos of the corpse of [ramiro] {} [d'orco] {} which was found cut up into four quarters in the square of [imola] {} and it is this the illustrious [cæsar] {} [borgia] {} is the prince who best knows how to deal with men according to their deserts it riled the king of [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} not to be able to deal with [riégo] {} as [borgia] {} had dealt with [ramiro] {} [d'orco] {} but he had to content himself with the prisoner being borne to the gibbet on hurdles and with the confiscation of his property even that would be quite a pretty spectacle on 5 [november] {} at noon [riégo's] {} sentence was read to him he listened to it very calmly this calmness disturbed the judges for it would set a bad example if [riégo] {} died bravely they took him to the chapel and under [pretence] {presence, pretense} that fasting induced penitence sooner than anything else they gave him nothing to eat from that time two monks accompanied him to his cell and never left him at the prison door in the street he could see a table with a crucifix thereon and [passers] {passels, passes, passer} by placed their alms on the table these alms were destined to pay the expenses of his mass and funeral on the 7th at nine in the morning the prison was besieged by over thirty thousand curious spectators a much greater number than that lined the whole of the route and formed a double line from the prison square to the square where the execution was to take place [riégo] {} had asked that only [spanish] {} troops should be present during his last moments this [favour] {favor} was granted him because [france] {prance, trance, fiance, francs, franc} did not wish to dip one corner of its white flag in the blood of the unlucky [riégo] {} at half past twelve after fifty hours of fasting the general was led forth to the prison door he was pale and weak they had stripped him of his uniform and they had clothed him in a dressing gown with a girdle fastened round his waist his hands and feet were likewise bound he was laid on a hurdle with a pillow under his head monks walked on both sides of this hurdle to administer spiritual consolation to him an ass drew the hurdle led by the executioner the victim was preceded and followed by a corps of cavalry it was difficult to get a good sight of the general so great was the curiosity of the crowd his head fell forward on his breast and he had only sufficient strength to raise it two or three times to reply to the exhortations of the priests the [cortège] {cortege} took nearly an hour to get from the prison to the place of execution when the foot of the gallows was reached the general was raised from the hurdle covered with dust and placed on the first step of the scaffold there he made his last confession then they dragged him up the ladder for his feet being bound he could not mount it himself all the while a priest kept beseeching god to forgive him his sins as he forgave those who had trespassed against him when they had hauled him a certain height those who raised the condemned man stopped the act of faith was begun and at the last word the general was hurled from the top of the ladder at the very instant that the priest pronounced the word [jésus] {} [christ] {} which was the signal the executioner [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} on the shoulders of the martyr while two men hung from his legs completing the hideous group twice the shout of [vive] {dive, five, give, hive, jive} [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [roi] {poi, rob, rod, roe, rot} went up first from the rows of spectators near by the second time from a few individuals alone then a man [leapt] {least, leaps, leap} from out the crowd stepped towards the scaffold and struck [riégo's] {} body a blow with his stick that night they carried the corpse into the nearest church and it was interred in the [campo] {cameo, camps, campy, camp} [santo] {canto} by the brothers of charity nothing is known of [riégo's] {} last moments as no one was allowed to come near him the monks his bitterest enemies being desirous of throwing all possible odium on his dying moments the last of the [gracchi] {} according to [mirabeau] {} in the act of death threw dust steeped in his own blood into the air thence was born [marius] {} [riégo]

played was the poisoning of [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet we have spoken of the death of poor little [fleuriet] {} who was as pretty fresh and flower like as her name and who was carried off in twenty four hours without any apparent reason for her death may i be forgiven the accusation implied in this statement for it may be a calumny but when the facts cited below are considered the cause of her death may be guessed on 29 may two young people arrived in what at that period was called [une] {one, use, dune, rune, tune} petite [voiture] {} and drew up at the [tête] {tote} [noire] {moire, noise} inn at saint cloud they had set off without leaving word where they were going towards nine o'clock in the evening they were installed in a double bedded chamber one of the couple paid a deposit of five francs the two friends walked about together the whole of the next day [friday] {} the 30th they only appeared at the hotel at dinner time and went out again immediately after their repast for another walk it was nine o'clock at night before they returned for the second time when going upstairs one of them asked for a half bottle of mulled wine adding that it need not be sugared as they had brought sugar with them the wine was taken up a few minutes after nine sugared with the sugar that they had brought and made tasty with lemons bought in saint cloud the same young man who made the five francs deposit for the room who ordered the dinner and forbade the sugar to be brought upstairs mixed the sugar and lemon juice in the bowl of warmed wine one of the two seemed to be a doctor for having heard that one of the servants of the house was ill he went upstairs to see him before tasting the prepared wine and felt his pulse however he did not prescribe anything for him and returned to his friend's room after an absence of a quarter of an hour the said friend had found the wine very nasty and had only drunk about a tablespoonful of it he had stopped short because of the bitter [flavour] {flavor} of the beverage in the midst of all this the chambermaid entered i must have put too much lemon in this wine said the young man holding the bowl towards her it is so bitter i cannot drink it the servant tasted it but she spat it out as soon as she had had a mouthful of it exclaiming oh yes rather you have made it bitter upon which she left the room the two friends went to bed throughout the night the young man who had tasted the wine was seized with violent spasms of nervous shivering which did not give him a moment's rest he complained to his companion several times that he could not keep himself still towards two o'clock he had fits of colic and at daybreak about half past three in the morning he said he did not think he would be able to get up that his feet were on fire and that he could not possibly put on his boots the other young man said he would take a turn in the park and recommended his friend to try and sleep in the meantime but instead of going for a walk in the park the young man whose visit to the sick servant led people to suppose him a doctor took a carriage returned to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} bought twelve grains of acetate of morphine from m robin rue [de] {be, he, me, re, we} la [feuillade] {} and one [drachm] {drachma} from m [chevalier] {} another chemist obtaining them readily in the capacity of a medical man he returned to the inn of the [tête] {tote} [noire] {moire, noise} at eight o'clock after four [hours'] {hours} absence and asked for some cold milk for his friend the sick man felt no better he drank the cup of milk prepared by the young doctor and almost immediately he was taken with fits of vomiting which rapidly succeeded each other soon he was seized by colic strange to say in spite of the attack becoming worse the doctor again left the patient alone without leaving any instructions and without appearing to be uneasy at a condition of things which was arousing the anxiety of strangers while he was absent the hostess of the hotel and the chambermaid went up to the sick man and did what they could for him he was in great agony the young doctor returned in about half an hour's time he found the patient in an alarming condition he was asking for a doctor insisting that one should be fetched from saint cloud and he opposed his friend's suggestion that one should be fetched from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} he felt so ill he said that he could not wait so they ran for the nearest available but nevertheless it was not until eleven o'clock in the morning that the doctor whom they went to seek arrived his name was m [pigache] {} the sick man was a little easier by that time m [pigache] {} asked to see the evacuations but he was told that they had been thrown away he ordered emollients but the emollients were not applied he came back an hour later and prescribed a soothing [draught] {fraught, drought} the young doctor administered it himself to the invalid but the effect it produced was prompt and terrible five minutes after the patient was seized by frightful convulsions in the midst of these convulsions he lost consciousness and from that moment never regained it towards eleven o'clock at night the young doctor weeping bitterly informed a servant that his friend could not survive the night the servant ran for m [pigache] {} who decided in spite of the short time he had attended him to pay the dying man one more visit he found the unhappy youth lying on his back his neck rigidly strained his head uncovered hardly able to breathe he could neither hear nor feel his pulse was slow his skin burning his limbs were stiff and rigid his mouth clenched his whole body was running with a cold sweat and marked with bluish spots m [pigache] {} decided he must at once bleed the patient freely and he bled him twice with leeches and with the lancet it made the sick man a little easier m [pigache] {} pointed this out to his young [confrère] {confrere} saying that the condition of the dying man was desperate and that as the good effect produced by the two [bleedings] {bleeding} was so noticeable he did not hesitate to propose a third but this the young doctor opposed saying that the responsibility was too great and that if the third bleeding ended badly the whole of the responsibility for the ending would rest on m [pigache] {} upon this the latter peremptorily demanded that a doctor should be sent for from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} this course would have been quite easy for during that very day as the result of a letter [despatched] {dispatched} by the young doctor couched in the following terms m ballet being ill at saint cloud [jean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} must come to him at once in the gig with the [grey] {prey, gray, grew} horse neither he nor mother [buvet] {duvet} must speak a word of this to a single soul if anybody makes inquiry they must say he is going into the country by order of m ballet [jean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} who was a [negro] {} servant arrived with the [grey] {prey, gray, grew} horse and the gig in spite of this facility of communication the young doctor made out that it was too late to send for a doctor from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} they waited therefore until three o'clock and at three o'clock [jean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} started off with two letters from m [pigache] {} to two of his medical friends m [pigache] {} left the house and as the young doctor accompanied him he said monsieur i think no time should be lost in sending for the priest of saint cloud your friend is a catholic and i think so badly of his condition that you ought to have the last sacraments administered to him without delay the young man [recognised] {recognized} the urgency of the advice and going himself to the house of the [curé] {curb, curd, cure, curl, curs} he brought him back with the sacristan the priest found the dying man in the same unconscious condition what is the matter with your unfortunate friend monsieur asked the priest brain fever replied the young man then as the [curé] {curb, curd, cure, curl, curs} was preparing to administer extreme unction the young doctor knelt down and remained in that position with clasped hands praying to god with such [fervour] {fervor} that the sacristan could not refrain from remarking when they had both left what a very pious young man that was the young doctor went out after the priest and remained away for nearly two hours towards three o'clock one of the two doctors that had been sent for arrived from [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} it was doctor [pelletan] {} junior m [pigache] {} informed of his arrival came and joined his [confrère] {confrere} at the bedside of the sick man but after a rapid examination both concluded that the patient was beyond human aid nevertheless they tried various remedies but without success all this time the young doctor appeared to be overcome with the most poignant grief a grief that expressed itself in tears and sobs these demonstrations of despair impressed m [pigache] {} all the more because in course of conversation the young doctor had said to him i am all the more unhappy as i am my unfortunate friend's legatee thereupon m [pelletan] {} addressing the weeping young man said to him have you reflected monsieur on the peril of your position what do you mean monsieur well listen you come with your friend for a couple of days to saint cloud you are a doctor you are anyway his legatee yes monsieur i am his [residuary] {} legatee very well the man who has bequeathed you his entire fortune is dying the symptoms of his illness are extremely peculiar and if he dies as is probable you will find yourself in a very awkward position what exclaimed the young man you think i shall be suspected i think that at any rate replied m [pelletan] {} all imaginable precautions will be taken to ascertain the cause of death as far as m [pigache] {} and myself are concerned we have decided that there ought to be a post [mortem] {} examination oh monsieur cried the young man you could not do me a greater service insist upon it demand a post [mortem] {} examination and you will play the part of a father to me if you do very well monsieur replied doctor [pelletan] {} seeing him so much excited do not be troubled not only shall the matter be carried through but it shall be carried through as delicately as possible and we will pay our utmost attention to it between noon and one o'clock that is to say within thirty or forty minutes of this conversation the dying man expired the reader will already have [recognised] {recognized} the two principal actors in this drama by the designation of the place where it happened and by the details of the victim's agony the dead man was [claude] {clause} [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet lawyer aged twenty five son of a rich [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} solicitor his friend was [edme] {edge} [samuel] {} [castaing] {castling, casting} who in a few [days'] {days} time would be twenty seven doctor of medicine born at [alençon] {} living in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} no 31 rue [d'enfer] {} his father an [honourable] {honorable} and universally respected man was inspector general of forests and [chevalier] {} of the [légion] {legion} [d'honneur] {} one hour after the death of [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet m [martignon] {} his brother in law warned by a letter from [castaing] {castling, casting} that [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet could not live through the day hurried to saint cloud where he found the sick man already dead while they were proceeding to search every object in the inn that might possibly throw some light on the cause of death [castaing] {castling, casting} still at large absented himself for nearly two hours no one knew what he did in his second absence he pretended he wanted fresh air and stated that he was going for a walk in the [bois] {boas, bobs, bogs, boos, bops} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [boulogne] {} m [pelletan] {} returned at ten o'clock next morning to make the post [mortem] {} examination he had left [castaing] {castling, casting} in full possession of his liberty but when he returned he found him under the surveillance of two policemen [castaing] {castling, casting} appeared very uneasy at the results to which a post [mortem] {} examination might lead but he seemed to feel sure that if the body did not present any trace of poison he would be set at liberty immediately the examination took place and an extremely circumstantial official report was drawn up but nowhere either in tongue or in stomach or in intestines could they detect the presence of any poisonous substance as a matter of fact acetate of morphine like [brucine] {} and strychnine leaves no more trace than is left by congestion of the brain or a bad seizure of apoplexy it was because of this a fact which [castaing] {castling, casting} knew well that when the priest had asked him from what his friend was suffering he had replied he has brain fever when the post [mortem] {} was finished without having revealed any material proof against the suspected person m [pelletan] {} asked the [procureur] {procurer} [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [roi] {poi, rob, rod, roe, rot} if he had any objection to [castaing] {castling, casting} being informed of the result no replied the [procureur] {procurer} [du] {cu, mu, nu, do, dz} [roi] {poi, rob, rod, roe, rot} simply communicate the result to him in general terms without making him think it is going to be either in his [favour] {favor} or to his detriment m [pelletan] {} found [castaing] {castling, casting} waiting for him upon the staircase well he asked the doctor eagerly have you concluded and come to release me i am unaware replied m [pelletan] {} whether they mean to release you or to detain you but the truth is we can find no trace of violent death in the body of [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet in spite of the temporary absence of material proof [castaing] {castling, casting} was kept a prisoner the preliminary investigation began it lasted from the month of [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} to the end of [september] {} on 10 [november] {} [castaing] {castling, casting} appeared at the prisoner's bar the affair had created a great sensation even before it was made public and the assize court presented the appearance usual when an important case is on that is to say so many lovely women and fashionably dressed men put in an appearance that one might have thought it the first night of a new play which had been announced with great pomp the accused was brought in an indefinable movement of interest agitated the spectators they bent forward and oscillated with curiosity looking like a field of corn tossed about by the wind he was a handsome young man well set up with a pleasant face although there was something rather odd in his expression as he looked at you without being elegantly attired he was dressed with care alas the preliminary investigation had revealed terrible facts [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet's death had caused judicial attention to be bestowed upon this unlucky family and it was discovered that since [castaing] {castling, casting} had known the family the father the mother the uncle had all disappeared struck down mortally within five months of each other leaving the two brothers [hippolyte] {} and [auguste] {august, auguster} a very considerable fortune and finally [hippolyte] {} died in his turn in [castaing's] {casting's} arms without either his brother [auguste] {august, auguster} or his sister madame [martignon] {} being able to get to him all these deaths had successively concentrated pretty nearly the whole of the family fortune on the head of [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet on 1 [december] {} 1822 [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet aged twenty four in health of mind and body at the time made a will constituting [castaing] {castling, casting} without any motive his [residuary] {} legatee with no reservations beyond a few small bequests to two friends and three servants [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet died in his turn on 1 [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} seven months after his brother now this is what the proceedings had elicited concerning the two points which in similar cases are specially investigated by those in charge of the case namely [castaing's] {casting's} intellectual and his physical life with regard to his intellectual life [castaing] {castling, casting} was a hard worker urged on by ambition burning with the desire to become rich his mother revealed horrible things concerning him if a letter that was seized at her house was to be believed his father reproached him with his licentious life and the sorrow with which he overwhelmed both his parents in the midst of all this he worked on [perseveringly] {} he passed his examinations he became a doctor anatomy botany and chemistry were the subjects to which he devoted most time especially chemistry his note books were produced full of observations extracts erasures they attested the determination shown in his researches and the profound study he had made of poisons of their various kinds of their effects of the palpable traces some leave on different bodily organs whilst some quite as deadly and more insidious kill without leaving any vestiges perceptible to the eyes of the most learned and experienced anatomist these poisons are all vegetable poisons [brucine] {} derived from false [angostura] {} strychnine from saint [ignatius] {} nut morphine from pure opium which is extracted from the [indian] {} poppy now it was a strange and terrible coincidence that on 18 [september] {} 1822 seventeen days before the death of [hippolyte] {} ballet [castaing] {castling, casting} bought ten grains of acetate of morphine twelve days later [hippolyte] {} suffering from a serious pulmonary disease but not yet in danger was seized with a deadly attack and died as we have said far from his sister and his brother after five [days'] {days} illness he died in [castaing's] {casting's} arms then [castaing's] {casting's} fortunes changed he who had been very hard up heretofore lent his mother thirty thousand francs and invested under assumed names or in bearer stock the sum of seventy thousand francs the matter was further complicated by matters arising out of the will of [hippolyte] {} ballet questions which will never be properly cleared up even in the law courts and which seemed to imply that [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet became [castaing's] {casting's} accomplice hence [auguste's] {} weakness for [castaing] {castling, casting} hence that will in his [favour] {favor} hence the intimacy between these two men who never separated from one another all these things were explained from the moment when instead of the ordinary bond of pure and simple friendship the link between them was supposed to be the indestructible chain of mutual complicity for and this is the time to return to his outward life that we have put to one side in order to speak of the intellectual life [castaing] {castling, casting} was not wealthy he lived on a moderate income allowed him by his mother his own efforts barely produced him five or six hundred francs per [annum] {annul} he had a mistress also very poor a widow with three children he had two other children by her so the young doctor had to keep a family of six persons whilst as yet he had no practice it seems that he adored his family especially his children letters were found showing warm fatherly affection in a heart that was consumed even more on behalf of others than on his own account with that thirst of ambition and that craving for riches which brought him to the scaffold we have seen that [castaing's] {casting's} finances suddenly became easier that he lent his mother thirty thousand francs and that he invested seventy thousand francs in assumed names or in bearer bonds then next we saw that on 29 may he arrived at saint cloud with [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet and that on 1 [june] {dune, rune, tune, jute, junk} [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet died leaving him [residuary] {} legatee [castaing] {castling, casting} was in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} on the evening he was absent under [pretence] {presence, pretense} of taking a walk he bought twelve grains from one chemist and one [drachm] {drachma} from a second of acetate of morphine or in other words of that vegetable poison which leaves no traces and of which he had already bought ten grains seventeen days before the death of [hippolyte] {} ballet the above is a [résumé] {} of the accumulated evidence brought against [castaing] {castling, casting} who had to face the jury under the weight of fifteen charges relative to the poisoning of [hippolyte] {} ballet of thirty four connected with the business of the will and of seventy six relative to the poisoning of [auguste] {august, auguster} ballet people will remember the different phases gone through during that long and terrible trial the steady denials of the prisoner and his bearing on receipt of the sentence condemning him to death a sentence decided by the turn of only one vote that is to say by seven against five the criminal stood with bared head and listened with frigid resignation to the sentence his hands clasped together silent his eyes and hands raised to heaven have you anything to say why sentence should not be carried out asked the judge [castaing] {castling, casting} sadly shook his head the head so soon to feel the chilly grip of death no monsieur he said in a deep but gentle voice no i have nothing to say against the carrying out of the sentence decreed against me i shall know how to die although it is a great misfortune to die hurried to the grave by such a dire fate as has overtaken me i am accused of having basely murdered my two friends and i am innocent oh indeed i repeat it i am innocent but there is a providence that which is immortal in me will go forth to find you [auguste] {august, auguster} [hippolyte] {} oh yes my friends (and here the condemned man stretched out both his arms to heaven most [impressively)] {impressively} oh yes my friends yes i shall meet you again and to me it will be a happy fate to rejoin you after the accusation brought against me nothing human can affect me now i look no longer for human pity i look only for heaven's mercy i shall mount the scaffold courageously cheered by the thought of seeing you again oh my friends this thought will rejoice my soul even when i feel alas continued the accused passing his hand across his neck alas it is easier to understand what i feel than to express what i dare not utter then in a lower tone you have decided on my death messieurs behold i am ready to die then turning to his counsel [maître] {} [roussel] {} he said look look [roussel] {} turn round come here and look at me you believed in my innocence and you defended me believing in that innocence well it is even so i am innocent take my farewell greetings to my father my brothers my mother my daughter then without any pause he went on addressing the amazed spectators and you young people you who have been present at my trial you my contemporaries will be present also at my execution you will see me there animated with the same courage as now and if the shedding of my blood be deemed necessary to society well i shall not regret that it has to flow why have i related the details of this terrible trial in such [fulness] {foulness, fullness, fullness} is it in order to awake gloomy memories of the past in the hearts of the members of those two unhappy families who may still be alive no it was because by reason of the reports connecting poor [fleuriet] {} with [castaing] {castling, casting} i was present at the final tragedy i begged a day's holiday from m [oudard] {} in order to see the end i was present among the number of those young people whom the condemned man in a moment of exaltation of delirium perhaps invited to his execution and when i saw that man so exuberantly young so full of life so eager after knowledge condemned to death bidding farewell to his father his mother his brothers his children society creation light in those poignant tones and miserable accents i said to myself in inexpressible anguish of heart o my god my god suppose this man should be another [lesurques] {} another [labarre] {} another [calas] {galas, colas, calks, calls, calms} o my god my god suppose this man be not guilty and then and there before the tribunal which had just condemned a man to death i vowed that no matter to what position i might attain i would never look upon it as justifiable to punish a sentient suffering human being like myself by the deprivation of life no i was not present at the execution for i must admit i could not possibly have borne such a spectacle and now twenty eight years have flown by between [castaing's] {casting's} execution and [lafourcade's] {} and they have been full of such cases in spite of the penalty of death which is meant to be a deterrent and does not deter alas how many wretched criminals have passed along the route that led from the [conciergerie] {} to the place [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [grève] {grave, grove} and now leads from la [roquette] {coquette, croquette} to the [barrière] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} saint [jacques] {} during those twenty eight years on 6 [december] {} at half past seven in the morning [castaing] {castling, casting} was led from [bicêtre] {} to la [conciergerie] {} a moment later the [gaoler] {} entered his cell and told him of the rejection of his petition behind the [gaoler] {} came the [abbé] {abbe, abbr} [montes] {mantes, monies, months, motes} [castaing] {castling, casting} then turned his attention to his prayers praying long and earnestly he did not utter a single word during the whole of the time he spent in the vestibule of the [conciergerie] {} while they were preparing him for his execution when he looked round at the vast crowd that awaited his appearance as he mounted into the cart his cheeks grew suddenly purple and then gradually subsided to a deathly paleness he only lifted his head at the foot of the scaffold it had remained sunk on his breast during the journey then glancing at the crowd again as he had done on coming out of the [conciergerie] {} he knelt at the foot of the ladder and after he had kissed the crucifix and embraced the worthy ecclesiastic who offered it him he climbed the scaffold held up by the executioner's two assistants he raised his eyes twice quite noticeably to heaven while they pinioned him on the fatal block then at fifteen minutes past two as the quarter chimed his head fell [castaing] {castling, casting} had experienced the sensation of death that he had not dared more clearly to define to the audience when he drew his hand across his neck [castaing] {castling, casting} had passed before his creator if guilty to receive forgiveness if innocent to denounce the real criminal he had asked to see his father to receive his benediction in [extremis] {extremes, extremism, extremist} the [favour] {favor} was refused him he next asked for this benediction to be sent him in writing it was sent to him thus but was first passed through vinegar before being handed to him they feared the paternal benediction might hide some poison by the aid of which [castaing] {castling, casting} might find means to cheat the scaffold of its due all was ended by half past two and those who wished to have comedy after tragedy still had time to go from the place [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [grève] {grave, grove} to take their stand in the queue outside the [théâtre] {} [français] {} on that day 6 [december] {} 1823 the École [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieillards] {} was played chapter [viii] {} [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} an appreciation of the man and of the poet the origin of the hatred of the old school of literature for the new some reflections upon [marino] {merino, marina, marine} [faliero] {} and the [enfants] {infants} [d'Édouard] {} why [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was more a comedy writer than a tragic poet where he found the ideas for his chief plays the first representation of the École [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieillards] {} played by [talma] {} and mademoiselle mars was a great occasion it was the first time indeed that these two great actors had appeared together in the same play [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} had laid down his own conditions expelled from the [théâtre] {} [français] {} under pretext that his work was badly put together he had profited by the proscription his [messéniennes] {} his [vêpres] {} [siciliennes] {} his [comédiens] {} and the [paria] {maria, parka, aria, pariah} and perhaps even more than all these the need felt by the opposition party for a liberal poet to set against [lamartine] {} and [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} the royalist poets of the period had made the author of the École [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieillards] {} so popular that with this popularity all difficulties were cleared away perhaps even too smoothly for like [richelieu] {} in his litter [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} returned to the [théâtre] {} [français] {} not through the door but by means of a gap i knew [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} very well as a man i studied him very much as a poet i never could get up much admiration for [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} as a poet but i have always had the greatest respect for him as a man as an individual in addition to his uncontested and incontestable literary probity [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was a man of pleasant polite even affable [demeanour] {demeanor} the first sight of him gave one the disagreeable impression that his head was much too big for his small body but his fine forehead his intelligent eyes his good [natured] {matured, natures, nature} mouth very soon made one forget this first impression although a man of great talent he was of the number of those who display it only when pen in hand his conversation pleasant and affectionate was [colourless] {colorless} and insipid as he lacked dignity of expression and strength of intonation so he lacked strength and dignity of actual words he attracted no notice at a salon people needed to have [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} pointed out before they paid any attention to him there are men who bear the stamp of their kingly dignity about with them wherever these people go they instantly command attention at the end of an hour's intercourse they reign [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was not one of them he would have declined the power of commanding attention had it been offered him had sovereignty been thrust upon him he would have abdicated all burdens even the weight of a crown were embarrassing in his eyes he had received an excellent education he knew everything that could be taught when he left college but since he left college he had [learnt] {learns, learn} very little by himself had thought but little had reflected but little one of the chief features of [casimir] {} [delavigne's] {} character and in our opinion one of his most unlucky attributes was his submission to other people's ideas a submission that could only arise from want of confidence in his own ideas oddly enough he had created among his friends and in his family a kind of censorship a sort of committee of repression commissioned to watch over his imagination and to prevent it from wandering this was all the more futile since [casimir] {} [delavigne's] {} imagination enclosed in decidedly narrow limits needed stimulating much more than restraining the result was that this [areopagitica] {} inferior as it was in feeling and above all in style to [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} himself played sad havoc with what little [picturesqueness] {} of style and imagination in plot he possessed this [depreciatory] {deprecatory} [cenacle] {} often reminded him that [icarus] {} fell because he flew too near the sun and i am sure he did not even dream of replying that if the sun melted [icarus's] {} wings it must have been because [icarus] {} had false wings fastened on with wax and that the eagle which disappears in the flood of fiery rays sent forth by the god of day never falls back on the earth as the victim of a similar accident the result of this abdication of his own will was that just when [casimir] {} [delavigne's] {} talent was at its best and his reputation was at its height he dared not do anything by himself or on his own initiative the ideas that arose in his brain were submitted to this committee before they were worked into proper shape the plot decided upon he would again put himself in the hands of this commission which commented upon it discussed it corrected it and returned it to the poet signed examined and found correct then when the plot became a play and was read before (of [course)] {coursed, courser, courses, course} the same assembly one would take a pencil another a pair of scissors a third a compass a fourth a rule and set to work to cut all vitality out of the play to such purpose that during the sitting the comedy drama or tragedy was lopped trimmed and cut about not according to the notions of the author but as mm so and so so and so so and so thought fit all conscientious gentlemen after their own fashion all talented men in their own line wise professors worthy savants able philologists but indifferent poets who instead of elevating their friend's efforts by a powerful breath of inspiration only thought instead of keeping him down on the ground for fear he should soar above them to realms where their short sighted glance could not follow him this habit of [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} of submitting his will to that of others gave him without his being aware of it himself a false modesty an assumed humility that embarrassed his enemies and disarmed those who were jealous of him how indeed could anyone begrudge a man his success who seemed to be asking everybody's leave to succeed and who appeared surprised when he did succeed or be envious of a poor poet who if they would but believe it had only succeeded through the addition to his feeble intelligence of abilities superior to his own or be vexed with such a quaking victor who implored people in the moment of his triumph not to desert him as [beseechingly] {} as a vanquished man might pray them to remain true to him under defeat and people were faithful to [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} even to the verge of fanaticism they extended hands of flattering devotion in homage to his renown the diverging rays of which like the flame of the holy spirit became divided into as many tongues of fire as the [casimirian] {} cult could muster apostles we have mentioned the drawbacks now let us point out the advantages of his popularity his plays were praised abroad before they were finished spoken highly of before they were received in the three classes of society to which [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} belonged by birth and i will even go so far as to say above all by his talent thus his [clientèle] {clientele} comprised through fortune [delavigne] {} who was an advocate all the law students in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} through [gustave] {} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [wailly] {} professor all the students of the [latin] {satin, lain} quarter through [jules] {mules, rules, julep, joules, juleps} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [wailly] {} chief clerk in the home office all the government officials this sort of family [clientèle] {clientele} was extremely useful for the purpose of doing battle with theatrical managers and publishers it knew [casimir] {} and did not allow him to undertake any business arrangements he was so modest that he would have unconditionally given his plays to the comedians his manuscripts to the publishers without any agreements [casimir] {} was aware of his failing in this direction he referred publishers and managers to his brother [germain] {} his brother [germain] {} referred them to his brother fortune and his brother fortune managed the affair on a business footing and i would point out that all this was done simply [guilelessly] {} in kindly fashion out of the admiration and devotion everybody felt towards [casimir] {} without intrigue for this assistance never prejudiced anyone who rendered it and i might even say without there being any coterie for in my opinion where there is conviction coteries do not exist now every friend of [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was absolutely and perfectly convinced that [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was the first lyric poet of his time the first dramatic poet of his century people who never came in touch with him and those who were stopped by the vigilant cordon which surrounded him acted for and praised him might well believe that these opinions emanated from himself as from the [centre] {} to the circumference but if they did get to close quarters with him they were soon persuaded of the simplicity the sincerity and the kindliness of that talented man i believe [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} never hated but one of his [confrères] {confreres} but him he hated well that man was victor [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} when the author of odes [et] {at, ct, ft, ht, it} [ballades] {ballads} of [marion] {maroon} [delorme] {} and of [nôtre] {} dame [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} was taken with the strange fancy of becoming the colleague of m [droz] {drop, doz} of m [briffaut] {} and of m [viennet] {} i took upon myself to go personally on his account to ask for [casimir] {} [delavigne's] {} vote i thought that such an intelligent person as the author of the [messéniennes] {} would regard it as the duty of one in his position to help as much as was in his power in providing a seat for his illustrious rival a candidate who had done the academy the [honour] {honor} of applying for a seat therein i was quite wrong [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} obstinately declined to give his vote to victor [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} and that with such vehemence and tenacity as i should have [dreamt] {dreams, dreamy, dream} him incapable of feeling especially towards me of whom he was extremely fond neither entreaty nor supplication nor argument could i will not say convince but even persuade him to agree and yet [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} knew well enough that he was rejecting one of the eminent men of his time i never found out the reason for this antipathy it was certainly not on account of their different schools i was most decidedly not of the school of [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} and he offered me the vote he withheld from victor [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} the poor academicians were in a sorry fix in my case for if i had put myself up i believe they would have elected me they nominated [dupaty] {} [hugo] {huge, hugs, hug} comforted himself by one of the wittiest sayings he ever made i believed he said that one could enter the academy par [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [pont] {cont, font, wont, pant, pent} [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} arts i was mistaken for it appears it is by the [pont] {cont, font, wont, pant, pent} [neuf] {} that entrance is effected and now that i have [criticised] {criticized} the man perhaps it may be thought that it will be a much more difficult matter still for me his [confrère] {confrere} his rival at times his antagonist to [criticise] {criticize, criticism} his poetry no my readers are [labouring] {laboring} under a misapprehension nothing is difficult to [whoso] {whose} speaks the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth moreover i have never written anything about a man that i was not ready to tell him to his face in order to judge [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} fairly we must glance over the period at which he was born and in which he lived we must speak of the imperial era what occasioned the burst of hatred that made itself felt after the appearance of [henri] {} [iii] {} of [marion] {maroon} [delorme] {} and of the [maréchale] {} [d'ancre] {} between the new and the old school of poetry and their representatives people have stated the fact without inquiring into its causes i can tell you them because during all the years that [napoleon] {} was levying his toll of 300 000 conscripts he did not perceive that the poets he looked for and looked for so vainly had been compelled to change their calling and that they were in camp sword musket or [sabre] {sable} in hand instead of pen in hand in their studies and this state of things lasted from 1796 to 1815 a period of nineteen years for nineteen years the enemy's cannon swept down the generation of men from fifteen to thirty six years of age so it came about that when the poets of the end of the eighteenth century and those of the beginning of the nineteenth confronted one another they found themselves hemmed in on each side by an immense ravine which had been hollowed out by the [grapeshot] {} of five coalitions at the bottom of this ravine a million of men were stretched and among this million of men snatched away before they had added to the population were those twelve poets that [napoleon] {} had so insistently demanded of m [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [fontanes] {} without being able to obtain them from him those who escaped were consumptive poets considered too feeble to undertake [soldiers'] {soldiers} duties who died young like [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} and [soumet] {} these were bridges thrown across the ravine of which we have just spoken but quite unequal to the task allotted them [napoleon] {} with his eighteen years of warfare and his ten [years'] {years} reign the re constructor of religion the re builder of society he who established legislation on a firm basis was foiled in the matter of poetry had it not been for the two men whom we have named [soumet] {} and [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} the thread of continuity would have been broken so it came about that [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} the connecting link between the old and the new schools showed always in his poetry a little of that [anæmic] {anemic} quality which was evident in his person in any work by [casimir] {} (which never exceeded the limits of one three or five acts ordained by the old theatrical [régime)] {} there was always something sickly and airless his plays lacked breath as did the man his work was as consumptive as the poet no one ever made three acts out of his one no one ever made five acts out of his three no one ever made ten acts out of his five but it was a simple task to reduce five of his acts to three three of his acts to one when imagination failed him and he appealed to [byron] {baron, boron} or [shakespeare] {} he could never attain their sublime heights he was obliged to stop short a third of the way up midway at the very utmost like a child who climbs a tree to gather apples and finds he cannot reach the ripest which always grow on the highest branches and are the most beautiful because they are nearest the sun save at the risk of breaking his neck a risk he is wise enough not to venture to take we will make our meaning clearer by a couple of instances [marino] {merino, marina, marine} [faliero] {} and the [enfants] {infants} [d'Édouard] {} in [byron's] {baron's, boron's} [marino] {merino, marina, marine} [faliero] {} the [doge] {loge, dole, dome, done, dope} plots to revenge himself on the youthful satirist who has insulted him by writing on his chair [marin] {maria, main, margin, marlin, martin} [falier] {falser, falter, flier} the husband of the fair wife others kiss her but he keeps her this was a calumny the fair [angiolina] {} is as pure as her name implies in spite of being but eighteen and her husband eighty it is therefore to defend a spotless wife and not to avenge the husband's outraged [honour] {honor} that [byron's] {baron's, boron's} [marino] {merino, marina, marine} [faliero] {} conspires and we hardly need say that the play gains in distinction by the passage across it of a sweet and lofty figure inflamed with devotion rather than suffused with repentance now in [casimir] {} [delavigne's] {} imitation on the contrary the wife is guilty [héléna] {} (for the poet in degrading her has not ventured to keep her heavenly [name)] {named, names, name} deceives her husband an old man she deceives him or rather she has deceived him before the rising of the curtain the first lines of the tragedy are concerned with a scarf that she is embroidering for her lover a serious blunder in our opinion for there could be only one means of making [héléna] {} interesting if she were to be made guilty and that would be to show the struggle in her between passion and virtue between love and duty in short to have done only more successfully what we did in [antony] {antonym} but we reiterate that it was far better to make the wife innocent as [byron] {baron, boron} does far better to put a faithful wife alongside the old man than an adulterous one far better in the fifth act where the wife seeks out her husband to let him find devotion and not repentance when his prison doors are opened when [christ] {} was bowed down under his bloody agony god chose the purest of his angels not a fallen one to carry him the cup of bitterness we will pass over the conspiracy which takes place in [venice] {} at midnight in the middle of the square of saint mark where fifty conspirators cry in eager emulation down with the republic in [venice] {} and at midnight in [venice] {} the city of the council of ten in [venice] {} the city that never really sleeps where at least half the populace is awake while the other half sleeps [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} did not venture to borrow anything from [shakespeare's] {} [richard] {} [iii] {} but the death of the two princes instead of that magnificent historical play by the [elizabethan] {} poet he substituted an insignificant little drama replete with [infantine] {infantile} [babblings] {babbling} and maternal tears of the great figure of [richard] {} [iii] {} of the [marvellous] {marvelous, marvelous} scene between the murderer and the wife of the murdered man and of the assassination of [buckingham] {} of the duel with [richmond] {} and [richard's] {} remorse nothing is left the gigantic statue the colossus of [rhodes] {} between whose legs the tallest galleys can pass has become a bronze ornament suitable for the top of a timepiece did [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} even take as much of the subject of the children of [edward] {} as he might have taken has he not turned aside from his model [shakespeare] {} with regard to the dignified way in which the characters of the heir to the throne and his gentle brother the duke of [york] {cork, dork, fork, pork, work} are treated we will adduce one example to demonstrate this in [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} when the young [richard] {} takes refuge in [westminster] {} abbey the church possessing the right to offer sanctuary the author of the [messéniennes] {} in order to compel the young prince to come out of the church causes a letter to be written apparently from his brother inviting him to come back to him at the palace the poor fugitive although surprised at receiving it puts reliance on this letter and comes out of his place of safety when he reaches the palace [richard] {} [iii] {} immediately arrests him in [shakespeare] {} the young prince also seeks this refuge what does [richard] {} [iii] {} do he sends for the archbishop and says to him has the crown prince sought refuge in your church yes [monseigneur] {} you must give him up to me impossible [monseigneur] {} why so because the church is a place of sanctuary for guilty men idiot replies [richard] {} but not for innocent ones how small to my thinking is [mézence] {} that [scoffer] {scoffed, coffer} at men and at gods by the side of [richard] {} [iii] {} who kills his innocent enemies just as another would kill his guilty enemies it will be understood that since [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was devoid both of [picturesqueness] {} and dignity he succeeded much better in comedy than in tragedy and we think his two best productions were the two comedies [les] {hes, mes, yes, lbs, lea} [comédiens] {} and the École [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieillards] {} it should be clearly understood that all we have to say is said from the point of view of a rigid standard of criticism and it does not therefore follow that [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was not gifted with very genuine qualities these good qualities were a facile aptitude for versification which only occasionally rises to poetic expression it is true but which on the other hand never quite descends to flabbiness and slackness and indeed from the beginning to the end of his work from the first line to the last whatever else his work may be it is careful presentable and particularly honest and please note that we have used the word honest as the most suitable word we could choose for [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} was never the kind of man to try and rob his public by stinting the work he had in hand in order to use similar material in his next piece no in the case of [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} one got one's money's worth as the saying is he gave all he possessed to the last farthing the spectators at the first production of each of his new plays had everything he had at that time to give them when midnight arrived and [amidst] {midst} the cheering of the audience his signature was [honoured] {honored} that is to say what he had promised he had performed he was a ruined man but what mattered it to be reduced to [beggary] {beggars, beggar, beggarly} he had owed a tragedy a drama a comedy he had paid to the uttermost farthing true it might perhaps mean his being compelled to make daily economies of mind spirit and imagination for one year two years three years before he could achieve another work but he would achieve it cost what it might at the expense of sleepless nights of his health of his life until the day came when he died worn out at fifty two years of age before he had completed his last tragedy well there was no need for the poet of the [messéniennes] {} the author of the École [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [vieillards] {} of [louis] {louts} [xi] {hi, mi, pi, ti, i} and of don [juan] {} to commiserate himself he who does all he can does all that can be expected of him nevertheless we shall always maintain that [casimir] {} [delavigne] {} would have done better still without his restraining body guard and we need not seek through his long winded works for proof of what we assert we will take instead one of the shorter poems which the poet wrote under stress of sadness a similar effort to m [arnault's] {} admirable [feuille] {} m [arnault] {} who was not only far less of a poet but still

has no boundaries for [talma] {} had been educated in the spacious school of [shakespeare] {} which intermingles laughter with tears the trivial with the sublime as they are intermingled in the pitiful struggle which we call life he knew what the drama should aim at he had played tragedy all his life and had never ventured to attempt comedy we will briefly relate how he came to be the man we knew [talma] {} was born in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} in the rue [des] {hes, mes, yes, dis, dos} [ménétriers] {} on 15 [january] {} 1766 when i became acquainted with him he would be about fifty seven he received from his godfather and godmother the names [françois] {} [joseph] {} and from his father that of [talma] {} in a letter from [talma] {} which i have by me it is stated that the name of [talma] {} which became celebrated by the deeds of the great artiste was several times made the subject of investigation by etymologists this autograph letter by [talma] {} is the copy of one in which he replies in 1822 to a savant of [gruningen] {} named [arétius] {} [sibrandus] {} [talma] {} who after giving details of his ancestry asks the modern [roscius] {} if he cannot lay claim to the [honour] {honor} of relationship with him this is [talma's] {} reply i do not know monsieur and it would be a difficult matter for me to find out whether you and i are of the same family when i was in [holland] {} more than fifteen years ago i [learnt] {learns, learn} that there were many people bearing the same name as myself in the land of [ruyter] {} and of [jan] {ban, can, fan, man, pan} [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [witt] {mitt, watt, wilt, wist, with} my family mainly inhabited a little strip of country six leagues from [cambrai] {} in french [flanders] {slanders} this is not the first time monsieur that my name has given rise to discussion with regard to my origin on the part of foreigners about forty or fifty years ago a son of the emperor of morocco staying in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} and hearing mention of my father's name came and asked him if it were not of [arabian] {} derivation a question that my father was unable to answer later an [arab] {crab, drab, grab} merchant whom i met in [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} in my youth put the same question to me i could not answer him more explicitly than could my father the son of his majesty of morocco m [langlais] {} a distinguished savant who had made a very profound study of oriental languages told me at that time that the word [talma] {} in the [arabic] {} tongue meant intrepid and that it was a very customary name among the descendants of [ishmael] {} to distinguish the different branches of the same family you may be sure monsieur that such an interpretation ought to make me very proud and i have ever done my utmost not to fall short of it i have consequently given rein to my imagination and conjecture that a [moorish] {boorish} family remained in [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} embraced [christianity] {} and wandered from that kingdom to the [netherlands] {} which were formerly under allegiance to the [spaniards] {} and that by degrees members of this family wandered into french [flanders] {slanders} where they settled but on the other hand i have been informed that our name has a [dutch] {butch, hutch, ditch} ending and that it was once very common in one of the provinces of [holland] {} this new version has completely upset my castle in [spain] {slain, stain, swain, spawn, pain} and conveyed me from the [african] {} deserts to the marshes of the united [netherlands] {} now monsieur you ought to be able to decide better than anyone certainly better than i since you speak [dutch] {butch, hutch, ditch} whether we really came from the north or from the south whether our ancestors wore turbans or hats whether they offered their prayers to [mahomed] {} or to the god of the [christians] {} i have omitted to give you another piece of information which is not without its relevancy namely that the count [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [mouradgea] {} [d'olisson] {} who lived in the east for some years and who has brought out a work on the religious systems of oriental peoples quotes a passage from one of their authors which tells us that the king or rather the pharaoh who drove the [israelites] {} out of [egypt] {} was called [talma] {} i have to admit that that king was a great scoundrel if the account given of him by [moses] {doses, hoses, loses, noses, poses} (surely a reliable [authority)] {authority} be correct but we must not look too closely into the matter if we wish to claim so illustrious an origin you see monsieur there is not a single [german] {merman, germane} baron who boasts his sixteen [quarterings] {quartering} not even a king throughout the four quarters of the globe were he even of the house of [austria] {} that oldest of all royal families who can boast such a lofty descent as mine however it may be monsieur believe me i hold it a much greater [honour] {honor} to be related to so distinguished a savant as yourself than to be the descendant of a crowned head such men as you work only for the good of men whilst others and by others i mean kings pharaohs and emperors think only of driving them mad i trust monsieur that since you seem to have made up your mind on this matter you would be so good as to inform me whether the name we bear is [dutch] {butch, hutch, ditch} or [arabian] {} in any case i congratulate myself monsieur upon bearing the name that you have made celebrated believe me etc etc [talma] {} this letter serves to give us both positive information concerning [talma's] {} family and a good idea of his way of looking at things [talma] {} often told me that his remotest recollections carried him back to the time when he lived in a house in the rue [mauconseil] {} the windows of which looked towards the old [comédie] {} [italienne] {} [theatre] {} he had three sisters and one brother also a cousin whom his father who was a dentist by profession had adopted one day lord [harcourt] {} came to [talma's] {} father to have a troublesome tooth extracted and he was so pleased with the way the operation was performed that he urged [talma's] {} father to go and live in [london] {} where he promised to procure him an aristocratic [clientèle] {clientele} [talma's] {} father yielded to lord [harcourt's] {} pressure crossed the channel and set up in [cavendish] {} square lord [harcourt] {} kept his promises he brought the french dentist such good customers that he soon became the fashionable dentist and included the prince of wales afterwards the elegant [george] {gorge} [iv] {id, if, in, is, it} among his clients the whole family followed its head but [talma's] {} father considering a french education better than any other sent his son back to [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} in the course of the year 1775 he was then nine years old and thanks to having spent three years in [england] {} at the age when languages are quickly picked up he could speak [english] {} when he reached [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} as well as he could speak french his father chose m [verdier's] {} school for him a year after he joined the school great news began to leak out m [verdier] {nerdier, verier} the head of the school had composed a tragedy called [tamerlan] {} this tragedy was to be played on prize day [talma] {} was hardly ten at that time so it was probable that he would not be allotted a leading part even if he were allowed to take any part in it at all the assumption is incorrect m [verdier] {nerdier, verier} gave him the part of a confidential friend it was like all such parts a score of lines strewn throughout the play and a monologue at the end in this peroration the bosom friend expatiates on the death of his friend who was condemned to death like [titus] {tutus, tits} by an inexorable father the beginning of this recitation went like a charm the bulk of it was successfully delivered also but towards the end the child's emotion grew to such a pitch that he burst into tears and fainted away this fainting fit marked his destiny for the child was an artiste ten years later on 21 [november] {} 1787 [talma] {} made his first appearance at the [théâtre] {} [français] {} in the part of [séide] {slide, snide, side} on the previous day he paid a visit to [dugazon] {} and [dugazon] {} gave him a paper containing the following advice i copy it from the original which is now in my possession aim at greatness from your first entry or at any rate at something above the common you must try to leave your mark and to make an appeal to the spirit of curiosity perhaps it may be better to hit straight than to strike hard but amateurs are legion and connoisseurs are scarce however if you can unite both truth and strength you will have the [suffrages] {suffrage} of all do not be carried away by applause nor allow yourself to be discouraged by hissing only fools allow themselves to be disconcerted by cat calls none but idiots are made dizzy by applause when applause is lavished without discrimination it injures talent at the very outset of its career some artistes have failed instead of having passed through their careers with distinction because of faults which genuine criticism might have pointed out or hissing punished [lekain] {} [peville] {} [fleury] {floury} were all hissed and they are immortal a and b and c have succumbed beneath the hail of too much applause what has become of them fewer means and more study less indulgence and more discipline are all pledges of success if not immediate and striking at least permanent and substantial do you want to captivate women and young people begin in the genre sensible 'tout [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [monde] {mode} [aime] {dime, lime, mime, rime, time} ' as [voltaire] {} says 'et [personne] {personae, personnel} [ne] {be, he, me, re, we} conspire ' at the same time what may have been good advice in his day may not be worth very much in ours if you want chiefly to delight the multitude which feels much and reasons but little adopt either a magnificent or an awe inspiring style they will instantly take effect how is it possible to sustain the dignified part of [mahomed] {} the condescension of [augustus] {} the remorse of [orestes] {} the impression to be made by such parts as [ladislas] {} [orosmane] {} and [bajazet] {} should be carefully prepared and it will then be [ineffaceable] {} true talent well supported and a fortunate [début] {debut} are a guarantee of immediate popularity but the artiste should strive to perpetuate them he must compel the public to go on appreciating after having applauded from conviction people should be made to continue their applause from habit that collective body of people whom we call the public has its caprices like any ordinary individual it must be coaxed and (may i go so far as to say [that)] {that} if it be won over by good qualities it is not impossible to keep its [favour] {favor} by faults you may use defects then to that end nevertheless you must be careful that they are those with which your judges will be in sympathy should the case be otherwise you may still have defects but they will be poor relations dogging the footsteps of your talent and welcomed only by reason of its greater authority [molé] {mold, mole, moll, molt} stammered and slurred [fleury] {floury} staggered and i have been reproached with over acting but [molé] {mold, mole, moll, molt} had indescribable charms [fleury] {floury} an alluring delivery and i make people laugh so heartily that the critic who tries to be solemn at my expense is never given a hearing there are [débutants] {} who shoot up like rockets shine for a few months and fall back into utter darkness there are several causes for such disasters their talents were either forced or without range or immature as the [english] {} say a few exhibitions have used them up one or two efforts have exhausted them perhaps too deviating from the path trodden by the masters they have entered the crooked labyrinths of innovation wherein only genius can lead temerity aright perhaps also and this is more hopeless still they have been bad copies of excellent originals and the public seeing that they have aped defects rather than copied [excellences] {excellence} has taken them for [parodists] {} and called their efforts caricatures when a comedian has reached this point the best thing for him to do is to escape out of it by the prompters side door and fly to pan to amuse the [basques] {masques} or to [riom] {room, riot, rim} to entertain the [auvergnats] {} but [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} lays claim to you my dear [talma] {} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} will cleave to you [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} will possess you and the land of [voltaire] {} and of [molière] {} of which you will become the worthy interpreter will not be long in giving you letters of [naturalisation] {naturalization} [dugazon] {} 20 [november] {} 1787 it is interesting to read the advice that [shakespeare] {} gave two centuries before through the mouth of hamlet to the players of his time it was as follows speak the speech i pray you as i pronounce it to you [trippingly] {} on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a [robustious] {} periwig [pated] {bated, dated, fated, gated, hated} fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the [groundlings] {groundings} who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for [o'erdoing] {overdoing} termagant it out [herods] {heroes, herons, herds} [herod] {heron, herd, hero} pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you [o'erstep] {overstep} not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the [unskilful] {unskillful, unskillful} laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance [o'erweigh] {} a whole [theatre] {} of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of [christians] {} nor the gait of [christian] {} pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's [villanous] {villainous} and [shows'] {shows} a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it let the successors of [lekain] {} and of [garrick] {} of [molé] {mold, mole, moll, molt} and of [kemble] {} of [talma] {} and of [kean] {bean, dean, lean, mean, wean} compare this last advice with the first and profit by both [talma] {} succeeded but there was nothing extraordinary about his success the [débutant] {} was marked out rather by amateurs than by the general public it was agreed that his acting was simple and natural the account books of the [comédie] {} [française] {} show that the receipts at [talma's] {} first appearance amounted to three thousand four hundred and three francs eight [sous] {nous, yous, sobs, sods, sols} now shall we hear the opinion of the critics on [talma's] {} [début] {debut} the journal [de] {be, he, me, re, we} [paris] {saris, pares, parks, parts, pars} wrote thus the young man who has just made his [début] {debut} in the character of [séide] {slide, snide, side} gives promise of most pleasing talents he possesses besides every natural advantage that it is possible to desire in the [rôle] {rile, role, rule} of a [jeune] {jejune} premier figure grace voice and the public were justified in their applause we will next see what [bachaumont] {} had to say about him the [débutant] {} possesses besides his natural gifts a pleasing face and a sonorous and expressive voice a pure and distinct pronunciation he both feels and can express the rhythm of his lines his deportment is simple his movements are natural moreover his taste is always good and he has no affectation he does not imitate any other actor but plays according to his own ideas and abilities two months later [le] {be, he, me, re, we} [mercure] {mercury} said apropos of the revival of [ducis'] {} hamlet we mean soon to speak of a young actor m [talma] {} who has caught the fancy of playgoers but we will wait until he has played more important parts his taste lies in the direction of tragedy it will readily be understood that the appearance of mademoiselle [rachel] {} met with a very different reception from these mild approbations and the explanation is not far to seek mademoiselle [rachel] {} was a kind of fixed star which had been discovered in the high heavens where she dwelt unmoved shining brilliantly [talma] {} on the contrary was a star destined to shine during a definite period to describe the gigantic arc that separates one horizon from another horizon to have his rising his zenith his setting a setting equivalent to that of the sun in mid august more fiery more magnificent more splendid in his setting than during the [noontide] {noontime} of his brightness and indeed what a triumphant progress his was from [séide] {slide, snide, side} to [charles] {charges} [ix] {ax, ex, ox, id, if}

{charges} [vi] {hi, mi, pi, ti, vs} but in spite of the brilliant career that was [talma's] {} lot he always regretted that he did not see the full dawn of the modern drama i spoke to him of my own hopes several times make haste he would say to me and try to succeed in my time well i saw [talma] {} play what very few people outside his own intimate circle were privileged to see him play the misanthrope which he never dared to put upon the boards of the [théâtre] {} [français] {} though he was anxious to do so a part of hamlet in [english] {} particularly the monologue also some farcical scenes got up at the saint [antoine] {} for m [arnault's] {} [fête] {fate, fete} art was [talma's] {} only care his only thought throughout his life without possessing a brilliant mind he possessed fine feeling much knowledge and profound discernment when he was about to create a new part he spared no pains in investigating what history or [archæology] {} might have to offer him in the way of assistance every gift good or indifferent that he possessed qualities as well as defects was [utilised] {utilized} by him a fortnight before his death when he rallied a little and the rally gave rise to the hope that he might again reappear at the [théâtre] {} [français] {} [adolphe] {} and i went to see him [talma] {} was having a bath he was studying [lucien] {} [arnault's] {} [tibère] {} in which he hoped to make his reappearance condemned by a disease of the bowels to die literally of starvation he was terribly thin but he seemed to find consolation even in his emaciated state and to derive hope of a success from it well my boys he said to us as he pressed his hanging cheeks between his hands won't these be just right for the part of old [tiberius] {} oh how great and glorious a
